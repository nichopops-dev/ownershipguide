    <div class="og-hero">
      <p>Fixed vs floating is not a “best rate” question. It’s a <strong>cashflow shock tolerance</strong> question: what happens to your life if rates move against you for 12 months?</p>

    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fixed</strong> buys stability. Choose it if a +1.0% to +1.5% rate shock would hurt your lifestyle or force bad decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Floating</strong> can be cheaper on average, but only if you have buffer and a plan when rates spike.</li>
        <li>If you may sell/upgrade/refinance soon, optimise for <strong>flexibility</strong> (avoid long lock-ins).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>The decision in one line</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <ul>
        <li>If you need instalment certainty: choose <strong>fixed</strong> (or partially fixed).</li>
        <li>If you have buffer and can tolerate swings: <strong>floating</strong> is viable.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Worked example (rate shock reality)</h2>
    <p class="muted">Illustrative only. The point is the size of the cashflow swing, not the exact dollar.</p>

    <h2>When fixed usually wins</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You’re near your TDSR edge and cashflow is tight.</li>
      <li>Your household income is variable (commission/business) and you want stability.</li>
      <li>You’re already taking other leverage risk (renovation, car loan, dependants).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When floating usually wins</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You have buffer and can tolerate instalment swings.</li>
      <li>You expect rates to fall or stay range-bound and want to capture that.</li>
      <li>You refinance opportunistically and want fewer constraints (check lock-in, clawbacks, prepayment rules).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The real question: what’s your “shock rate”?</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p>Your shock rate is the highest interest rate you can absorb without lifestyle damage or forced selling.</p>

    <h2>Decision checklist</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>What is your maximum safe monthly instalment?</li>
      <li>How many months of buffer do you have if rates spike?</li>
      <li>Are you likely to sell/upgrade/refinance within the fixed period?</li>
      <li>What are the lock-in, clawback, and prepayment rules?</li>
      <li>What will you do if rates go against you for 12 months?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <h3>Is fixed always safer?</h3>
      <p>Fixed is safer for cashflow volatility, but it can be expensive insurance if the rate premium is large and you have strong buffers.</p>
      <h3>Can I mix fixed and floating?</h3>
      <p>Some borrowers treat fixed as insurance (stability) and floating as an upside option. The key is that your downside must be survivable.</p>
      <h3>How does this link to refinance/reprice?</h3>
      <p>Fixed vs floating is your risk profile. Reprice/refinance is your switching decision. They work together.</p>
