  <div class="og-hero">
    <p>You don’t win this decision by predicting rates. You win by choosing the structure that keeps your household <strong>anti-fragile</strong> when rates move.</p>

  <h2>The decision in one line</h2>
  <div class="box"><ul><li>If you need payment certainty, have thin buffers, or rates are low: <strong>fix</strong>.</li><li>If you have buffers, can refinance quickly, and can tolerate volatility: <strong>floating</strong> can win.</li></ul></div>

  <h2>The real risk people underestimate</h2>
  <p>It is not “rates might go up”. It is <strong>cashflow fragility</strong>: a higher instalment forces you to cut spending, sell investments, or panic-sell property at the wrong time.</p><div class="box"><ul><li><strong>Fixed</strong> buys you a ceiling on pain.</li><li><strong>Floating</strong> buys you optionality (reprice/refinance), but you must survive the spikes.</li></ul></div>

  <h2>A simple decision framework (use this, not forecasts)</h2>
  <div class="box">
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Stress test your instalment</strong> at +1.5% and +2.0% from today’s rate.</li>
      <li>If that stress test causes lifestyle panic or forces you to sell assets: prefer <strong>fixed</strong>.</li>
      <li>If you can absorb it comfortably and have a plan to reprice/refinance: <strong>floating</strong> is viable.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <h2>What “buffer” actually means</h2>
  <div class="box">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cash buffer</strong>: enough liquid cash to handle rate spikes without missing payments.</li>
      <li><strong>Psychological buffer</strong>: you won’t panic when the instalment rises.</li>
      <li><strong>Optionality buffer</strong>: you can switch packages (reprice/refinance) when the tradeoff flips.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="meta">If you don’t have all three, fixed is often the lower-regret choice even if the headline rate is higher.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Common strategies that reduce regret</h2>
  <div class="box">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stabilise then optimise</strong>: choose fixed for 1–3 years, then reassess and switch if appropriate.</li>
      <li><strong>Floating with guardrails</strong>: floating package + strict buffer rule + calendar reminder to review every 6–12 months.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid long lock-ins</strong> unless the discount is large and your timeline is stable.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <div class="box">
    <h3>What if I think rates will fall?</h3>
    <p>Don’t bet your household stability on a forecast. If you go floating, make sure you can survive if you’re wrong.</p>
    <h3>What if I might sell/upgrade soon?</h3>
    <p>Prefer optionality: lower penalties, clearer exit terms, and avoid long lock-ins.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>A practical framework (Singapore)</h2>
  <div class="box"><ol><li><strong>Define your buffer</strong>: 6–12 months of instalments in cash/near-cash if floating; 3–6 months if fixed.</li><li><strong>Define your horizon</strong>: if you expect to sell/upgrade/refinance within ~2–3 years, flexibility matters more.</li><li><strong>Stress test</strong>: ask “If instalment rises by +20–30%, do we still sleep at night?”</li></ol></div>

  <h2>Common Singapore patterns</h2>
  <ul><li><strong>First home, young kids, single income risk</strong> → fixed (or partial fix) is often rational.</li><li><strong>High-income dual earners, large buffers</strong> → floating with discipline can be fine.</li><li><strong>Rates feel “low”</strong> → fixing can be cheap insurance.</li></ul>

    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fixed</strong> buys stability. Choose it if cashflow shock would hurt you or you value certainty more than squeezing the last basis point.</li>
      <li><strong>Floating</strong> can be cheaper on average, but you must survive volatility. Choose it if you have buffer, flexibility, and a plan if rates spike.</li>
      <li>Don’t pick based on “today’s rate”. Pick based on <strong>what you will do if rates move against you</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <h2>How to decide in 60 seconds</h2>
  <div class="og-callout">
    <ol>
      <li>If a +1.5% rate shock breaks your budget → choose <strong>Fixed</strong>.</li>
      <li>If you have 12–24 months buffer and can prepay if needed → <strong>Floating</strong> is viable.</li>
      <li>If you expect to sell/refinance soon → avoid long lock-ins; optimise for <strong>flexibility</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <h2>What “fixed” really means in Singapore</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Typically fixed for 1–5 years, then it reverts to a floating/board rate.</li>
    <li>Often comes with a lock-in period (check early redemption and clawback terms).</li>
    <li>You’re paying for insurance against rate spikes and cashflow stress.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What “floating” really means</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Usually pegged to <strong>SORA + spread</strong> or other bank benchmarks.</li>
    <li>Your instalment moves with rates (sometimes with a lag depending on package mechanics).</li>
    <li>You’re trading stability for expected savings — but must manage downside risk.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When fixed usually wins</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You’re near your TDSR edge and cashflow is tight.</li>
    <li>Your household income is variable (commission/business) and you want stability.</li>
    <li>You’re already taking other leverage risk (e.g., renovation, car loan, dependants).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When floating usually wins</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You have buffer and can tolerate instalment swings.</li>
    <li>You expect rates to fall or stay range-bound and want to capture that.</li>
    <li>You might refinance opportunistically and want fewer lock-in constraints.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The real question: what’s your “shock rate”?</h2>
  <p>Your shock rate is the highest interest rate you can absorb without lifestyle damage or forced selling.</p>
  <p>Instead of guessing, stress test it:</p>

  </ul>

  <h2>Decision checklist</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>What is your maximum safe monthly instalment?</li>
    <li>How many months of buffer do you have if rates spike?</li>
    <li>Are you likely to sell/upgrade/refinance within the fixed period?</li>
    <li>What are the lock-in and prepayment rules?</li>
    <li>What will you do if rates go against you for 12 months?</li>
  </ol>
