        <li><strong>Rate:</strong> What is your effective mortgage rate after promo ends and fees?</li>
        <li><strong>Horizon:</strong> Can you hold investments for 5–10+ years without needing the money?</li>

    <h2>Pay down mortgage vs invest: the real comparison</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Paying down mortgage</strong> is a <em>risk-free “return”</em> equal to your interest rate (after fees), and it reduces fragility.</li>
        <li><strong>Investing</strong> has higher expected return but real volatility — and can fail exactly when your cashflow is stressed.</li>
        <li>In Singapore, your decision is often <strong>three-way</strong>: pay down mortgage vs invest vs keep liquidity (buffers).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Decision rules (simple)</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prioritise buffers first:</strong> if a job shock would force a sale, liquidity beats optimisation.</li>
        <li><strong>Pay down mortgage</strong> if your effective interest rate is high, you have low risk tolerance, or cashflow fragility is your main problem.</li>
        <li><strong>Invest</strong> if you have stable buffers, long horizon, and you can hold through drawdowns without panic-selling.</li>
        <li>When rates are low, the “math” favours investing — but the <strong>behavioural</strong> risk still dominates for many households.</li>
      </ul>
