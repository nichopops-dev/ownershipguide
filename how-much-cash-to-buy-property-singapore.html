<p>
Most buyers focus on “25% downpayment.”
</p>
<p>
That is incomplete.
</p>
<p>
In Singapore, the real cash requirement includes:
<strong>downpayment + stamp duties + legal fees + renovation buffer + liquidity reserve.</strong>
</p>
<div class="box">
<p><strong>Before calculating cash:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Understand full ownership structure:
<a href="/property-ownership-cost-singapore.html">5-Year Property Ownership Model</a></li>
<li>If still deciding between renting and buying:
<a href="/rent-vs-buy-property-singapore.html">Rent vs Buy Framework</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<hr/>
<h2>Step 1 — Downpayment Structure</h2>
<p>
For most private properties:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to 75% loan (subject to eligibility)</li>
<li>25% downpayment</li>
<li>Minimum 5% must be paid in cash</li>
<li>Remaining portion can often be CPF (subject to limits)</li>
</ul>
<p class="muted">Your loan size is gated by bank rules (TDSR/MSR), not just what you feel comfortable paying monthly. Read: <a href="/tdsr-msr-singapore.html">TDSR &amp; MSR borrowing limit (Singapore)</a>.</p>
<p>
For HDB, rules differ depending on loan type.
Always confirm current MAS/HDB guidelines.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Step 2 — Buyer’s Stamp Duty (BSD)</h2>
<p class="muted">If you want the decision framework behind stamp duty (and when ABSD becomes a deal-breaker), read: <a href="/bsd-absd-singapore.html">BSD &amp; ABSD explained</a>.</p>
<p>
BSD is payable upfront (cash or CPF).
It is unavoidable entry friction.
</p>
<h3>Illustrative Ranges</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>$800,000 resale HDB</strong> → BSD roughly in the ~$20k+ range</li>
<li><strong>$1,500,000 condo</strong> → BSD moves into five-figure high range (~$40k+)</li>
</ul>
<p class="muted">
Exact BSD is tiered. Always calculate using current IRAS schedule.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Step 3 — Legal, Valuation &amp; Misc Fees</h2>
<ul>
<li>Conveyancing legal fees</li>
<li>Bank valuation</li>
<li>Fire insurance</li>
<li>Admin/processing charges</li>
</ul>
<p>
Usually smaller than BSD — but still thousands of dollars.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Step 4 — Renovation &amp; Setup Buffer</h2>
<p>
This is where many budgets break.
</p>
<p>
Even conservative renovation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Resale HDB → easily $40k–$80k</li>
<li>Condo → can vary widely depending on condition</li>
</ul>
<p>
Renovation overshoot is a common liquidity shock.
</p>
<p class="muted">Deep dive: <a href="/renovation-cost-singapore.html">Renovation Cost in Singapore (framework + hidden items)</a>.</p>
<p>
Do not treat it as optional.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Step 5 — Emergency Liquidity Floor</h2>
<div class="box">
<p><strong>Resilience Rule:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain at least 6 months of expenses after completion.</li>
<li>Stress-test +0.5% interest rate.</li>
<li>Do not reduce liquidity to near-zero.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="muted">Also plan for sale proceeds reality: <a href="/cpf-accrued-interest-singapore.html">CPF accrued interest (why cash-out shrinks)</a>.</p>
<p class="muted">To see what interest rate movement does to your real cost (and why +0.5% matters), read: <a href="/mortgage-interest-cost-singapore.html">Mortgage Interest Cost in Singapore</a>.</p>
<p>
If buying drains you to minimal cash,
your structure is fragile.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Example A — $800k Resale HDB (Reality Check)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Downpayment (25%) → $200k</li>
<li>BSD → ~$20k+</li>
<li>Legal &amp; misc → several thousand</li>
<li>Renovation → $40k–$80k</li>
<li>Emergency reserve → depends on lifestyle</li>
</ul>
<p>
Total upfront exposure can exceed $260k+ depending on renovation and buffer.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Example B — $1.5M Condo (Reality Check)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Downpayment (25%) → $375k</li>
<li>Minimum 5% cash → $75k</li>
<li>BSD → ~$40k+</li>
<li>Legal &amp; misc → thousands</li>
<li>Renovation → variable</li>
<li>Emergency buffer → critical</li>
</ul>
<p>
Total capital lock-up often exceeds $450k+ before considering buffer.
Absolute dollars matter more than percentages.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>CPF Mechanics (What Many Misunderstand)</h2>
<ul>
<li>CPF used accrues 2.5% interest.</li>
<li>Upon sale, CPF + accrued interest must be refunded.</li>
<li>This affects your net sale proceeds.</li>
</ul>
<p>
CPF is not free money.
It is deferred opportunity cost.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Fragile vs Resilient Purchase Structure</h2>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Factor</th>
<th>Fragile</th>
<th>Resilient</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Post-purchase cash</td>
<td>Near zero</td>
<td>6+ months buffer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rate sensitivity</td>
<td>0.5% breaks affordability</td>
<td>Comfortable margin</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Renovation</td>
<td>Unplanned overspend</td>
<td>Budgeted + buffer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holding period</td>
<td>Uncertain</td>
<td>Stable 5+ years</td>
</tr>
</table>
<hr/>
<h2>Final Rule</h2>
<p>
The right question is not:
</p>
<p><strong>“How much cash do I need to qualify?”</strong></p>
<p>
It is:
</p>
<p><strong>“How much cash do I need to stay resilient for 5 years?”</strong></p>

<h2 style="margin-top:0;">How to use this page</h2>
<p>This page is a decision helper. Use it to get a first-pass estimate and compare options. If you’re making a high-stakes decision (loan, property purchase, vehicle purchase), treat results as directional and verify with official sources and your provider.</p>

<h2>Scenario library (use these as sanity checks)</h2>
<p>These are simplified, real-world style scenarios to help you sanity-check your own cash plan. Use them as a starting point, then run the exact numbers with your own price point and loan assumptions.</p>
<h3>Scenario 1 — $650k resale HDB, bank loan</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash:</strong> option/booking + legal/valuation buffer + early reno deposit</li>
<li><strong>CPF:</strong> downpayment + stamp duties (if you have enough OA) + monthly instalments later</li>
<li><strong>Watch-out:</strong> timeline gaps where you need cash before CPF reimbursements clear</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scenario 2 — $1.2m condo, 75% loan</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash floor:</strong> treat BSD/ABSD timing + legal fees as “must-have cash” even if you plan to reimburse via CPF</li>
<li><strong>Buffer:</strong> 6–12 months of instalment runway if you’re stretching TDSR</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scenario 3 — second property purchase (ABSD involved)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash intensity:</strong> ABSD usually forces a much higher cash requirement upfront</li>
<li><strong>Planning key:</strong> align sale timeline, bridging, and ABSD remission rules (if applicable) before committing</li>
</ul>
