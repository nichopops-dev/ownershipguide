    <h1>Car Loan vs Pay Cash (Singapore, 2026)</h1>
    <p class="muted">Updated: February 2026</p>

    <div class="og-card og-card--hero">
      <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Compare the <strong>guaranteed</strong> cost of borrowing (interest) against the <strong>value of liquidity</strong> and your ability to survive shocks.
      If paying cash empties your buffer, “cheaper” becomes fragile.</p>

    <h2>Decision rules (simple)</h2>
    <div class="og-checklist">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pay cash</strong> if you can still keep a strong cash buffer after paying (repairs + insurance + income shocks).</li>
        <li><strong>Use a loan</strong> if it preserves resilience and the interest cost is reasonable relative to your buffer value.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid stretching</strong>: if the loan is what makes the car “affordable”, it’s usually a trap.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Worked example (illustrative)</h2>
    <p class="muted">Numbers are simplified to show the logic. Use your actual loan quote and cash position.</p>

    <table class="og-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Scenario</th>
          <th>Pay cash</th>
          <th>Take loan</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Car price</td>
          <td>$80,000</td>
          <td>$80,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Cash buffer after purchase</td>
          <td>$5,000</td>
          <td>$35,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Loan amount / terms</td>
          <td>—</td>
          <td>$60,000 / 5 years @ 3.5%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Approx interest paid</td>
          <td>$0</td>
          <td>~$5k–$6k</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Fragility risk</td>
          <td>High (thin buffer)</td>
          <td>Lower (buffer preserved)</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>If the “cash” option leaves you one repair bill away from panic, the real cost isn’t interest — it’s <strong>fragility</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Common failure modes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>“Loan makes it affordable”</strong> — you sized the car to the loan, not to resilience.</li>
      <li><strong>Over-downpayment</strong> — you “save interest” but lose buffer and optionality.</li>
      <li><strong>Ignoring repairs</strong> — especially on used cars; thin buffers become debt spirals.</li>
    </ul>

      <details class="og-faq-item">
        <summary>Is paying cash always cheaper than taking a car loan?</summary>
        <div class="og-faq-body">Not always. Cash can be 'cheaper' on paper but more fragile in real life if it drains your buffer. The right comparison is interest cost vs the value of keeping liquidity (and optionality).</div>

      <details class="og-faq-item">
        <summary>When is a car loan rational in Singapore?</summary>
        <div class="og-faq-body">When the loan cost is manageable, you keep a healthy emergency buffer, and you can handle rate/expense shocks without missing payments. Borrow to preserve resilience, not to stretch into a bigger car.</div>

      <details class="og-faq-item">
        <summary>What downpayment should I use as a rule of thumb?</summary>
        <div class="og-faq-body">A higher downpayment reduces interest, but don't empty your buffer. If paying more down leaves you with <3–6 months of expenses in cash/near-cash, you may be buying 'cheaper' but becoming fragile.</div>

      <details class="og-faq-item">
        <summary>Should I invest the cash instead of paying the car outright?</summary>
        <div class="og-faq-body">Only if you can stomach volatility and still keep enough buffer for repairs, insurance, and income shocks. Compare guaranteed savings (loan interest avoided) vs uncertain returns, after taxes/fees and risk.</div>
