        <li><strong>Horizon:</strong> Will you hold for 5–10 years (or might you sell soon)?</li>
        <li><strong>Buffers:</strong> Do you have 6–12 months runway after downpayment?</li>
        <li><strong>Rate shock:</strong> Can you survive +1–2% rates and higher costs together?</li>
        <li><strong>Life plan:</strong> Is your job/school/family plan stable enough to commit?</li>
        <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Is renting acceptable while you build buffers and clarity?</li>

    <h2>Buy now vs wait: what changes the answer</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Your horizon:</strong> if you might sell in &lt;5 years, timing mistakes are amplified by transaction costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Cashflow fragility:</strong> if a rate shock breaks you, “buy now” is not brave — it’s brittle.</li>
        <li><strong>Price vs rate trade:</strong> a “cheaper price” can be offset by a higher rate (and vice versa). You need an exposure lens.</li>
        <li><strong>Life optionality:</strong> if your job/location/family plan is uncertain, waiting can be rational even if the math says “buy”.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Decision rules (Singapore reality)</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Buy now</strong> if you have buffer, long horizon, and the purchase improves your life even under conservative assumptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Wait</strong> if you are stretching affordability, you lack buffer, or your life plan is unstable (moving schools/jobs, family timing).</li>
        <li>If you’re “waiting for the perfect bottom”, you’re usually just trading one risk (price) for another (rate/opportunity cost).</li>
      </ul>
