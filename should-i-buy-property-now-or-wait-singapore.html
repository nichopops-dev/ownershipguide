  <h1>Should You Buy Property Now or Wait in Singapore? (2026 Timing Framework)</h1>

  <p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <p>
    Most people treat this as a market prediction problem.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is not.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Singapore, property timing is primarily a <strong>resilience question</strong>:
    can your decision survive realistic interest rates, flat prices, and a longer-than-expected holding period?
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <p><strong>Fast Path (use this order)</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1)</strong> Anchor the full cost structure:
        <a href="/property-ownership-cost-singapore.html">5-year property ownership model</a>
      </li>
      <li><strong>2)</strong> Choose subtype:
        <a href="/condo-ownership-cost.html">condo</a> ·
        <a href="/bto-vs-resale-cost.html">BTO vs resale</a>
      </li>
      <li><strong>3)</strong> Stress-test interest rate sensitivity (below).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <hr>

  <h2>Quick Answer (Conservative Rule)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>If you can hold <strong>5+ years</strong> and survive realistic rate movement → timing matters less.</li>
    <li>If your plan breaks at <strong>+0.5% interest rate</strong> → waiting or restructuring may be rational.</li>
    <li>If you might sell within <strong>2–3 years</strong> → timing risk dominates.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>The 3-Factor Timing Rule</h2>

  <div class="box">
    <p><strong>Factor 1 — Holding Period</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>1–2 years: friction compression risk.</li>
      <li>3–5 years: still timing-sensitive.</li>
      <li>5+ years: friction spreads out; resilience improves.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Factor 2 — Interest Rate Sensitivity</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stress-test at 3.0%, 3.5%, 4.0%.</li>
      <li>If 0.5% higher breaks your cashflow, the plan is fragile.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Factor 3 — Liquidity Buffer</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>After downpayment + BSD + fees, do you still have buffers?</li>
      <li>If buffers are thin, timing becomes dangerous.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <hr>

  <h2>Example Modelling (Singapore Price Bands)</h2>

  <h3>Scenario A — $800k Resale HDB</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Loan: ~75%</li>
    <li>Interest baseline: 3.5%</li>
    <li>Holding: 5 years</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If rates rise from 3.5% to 4.0%, total 5-year interest drag increases materially.
    If your cashflow margin is thin, this change alone can shift the decision.
  </p>

  <h3>Scenario B — $1.5M Condo</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Higher absolute BSD</li>
    <li>Higher MCST / maintenance</li>
    <li>Larger liquidity lock-up</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    At this scale, small percentage changes in rates translate into larger absolute dollars.
    Condo timing is therefore more sensitive if buffers are thin.
  </p>

  <h2>Flat, Rising, Falling — 3 Market Scenarios</h2>

  <div class="box">
    <p><strong>Flat prices (0% growth)</strong></p>
    <p>Can you still justify the decision based purely on use and long-term holding?</p>

    <p><strong>Mild rise (1–2% annually)</strong></p>
    <p>Upside improves resilience, but should not be assumed.</p>

    <p><strong>Mild decline (-5% over period)</strong></p>
    <p>If this breaks your plan, your structure was speculative.</p>
  </div>

  <hr>

  <h2>Friction Compression (Why 2 Years Is Dangerous)</h2>

  <p>
    Buyer friction (BSD + legal) and seller friction (agent + legal)
    do not shrink just because your timeline shrinks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Selling in 2 years instead of 5 compresses those fixed costs into a shorter period,
    amplifying timing risk.
  </p>

  <h2>HDB vs Condo Timing Sensitivity</h2>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Factor</th>
      <th>HDB Resale</th>
      <th>Condo</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Entry friction</td>
      <td>Moderate</td>
      <td>Higher (BSD larger absolute)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ongoing fixed cost</td>
      <td>Lower</td>
      <td>MCST always-on</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Rate sensitivity</td>
      <td>Moderate</td>
      <td>Higher absolute exposure</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Short-hold risk</td>
      <td>Elevated</td>
      <td>Higher</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Decision Matrix</h2>

  <div class="box">
    <p><strong>Buy Now if:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>5+ year horizon is stable</li>
      <li>Rate stress test passes</li>
      <li>Buffers remain intact</li>
      <li>You are buying for use, not speculation</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Wait if:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Holding period uncertain</li>
      <li>Rate increase breaks monthly cashflow</li>
      <li>Buffers are thin</li>
      <li>Decision depends on price appreciation</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <hr>

  <h2>What Waiting Actually Means</h2>

  <p>
    Waiting does not guarantee:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Lower prices</li>
    <li>Lower rates</li>
    <li>Better units</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It simply delays capital lock-up.
    If waiting strengthens your buffers and resilience, it can be rational.
    If waiting is based purely on prediction, it is still speculative.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Final Rule</h2>

  <div class="box">
    <p>
      A good property decision should survive:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>+0.5% rate movement</li>
      <li>Flat prices</li>
      <li>A longer holding period than planned</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>
    If your structure survives that, “buy now vs wait” becomes execution timing —
    not speculation.
