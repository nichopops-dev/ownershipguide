    <p>
      This is one of the most common Singapore property shocks:
      you sell “at a profit”, then your cash proceeds look tiny.
      In most cases, it’s not a scam — it’s <strong>CPF refund mechanics</strong>.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Fast answer:</strong> If you used CPF OA for the downpayment and monthly instalments,
      CPF must be refunded <strong>principal + accrued interest</strong> when you sell. That refund happens
      <em>before</em> you see any remaining cash.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2 id="mechanics">1) What Gets Refunded When You Sell</h2>
    <p>
      When you sell a property in Singapore, your sale proceeds are typically applied in this order:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Outstanding loan redemption</strong> (pay off the bank)</li>
      <li><strong>CPF refund</strong>: CPF OA used for the property <em>plus</em> CPF accrued interest</li>
      <li><strong>Remaining balance</strong> becomes your cash proceeds (if any)</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="muted">
      That’s why you can “sell higher than you bought” and still receive very little cash —
      the bank and CPF are paid first.
    </p>

    <h2 id="accrued">2) What CPF “Accrued Interest” Means</h2>
    <p>
      CPF frames property use as an <strong>opportunity cost</strong>: if your OA money wasn’t used for the property,
      it would have earned OA interest inside CPF. So CPF tracks a running “what your OA would have become”.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Principal used</strong>: downpayment + monthly instalments paid with OA</li>
      <li><strong>Accrued interest</strong>: the OA interest CPF treats as foregone</li>
      <li><strong>Refund at sale</strong>: principal + accrued interest (subject to sale proceeds)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Think of it as restoring your CPF position, not paying a random extra fee.
      It feels painful because it reduces cash-out, but the value is still “yours” — now back in CPF.
    </p>

    <h2 id="profit">3) Paper Profit vs Cash in Hand</h2>
    <p>
      Many people calculate “profit” as:
      <strong>Sale price − purchase price</strong>.
      That’s incomplete.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your real cash-out depends on:
      <strong>sale price</strong> minus <strong>loan redemption</strong> minus <strong>CPF refund</strong> minus
      <strong>selling costs</strong>.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Reality check:</strong> If you used CPF heavily (especially over many years),
      your CPF refund can absorb most of the sale proceeds — even if the property appreciated.</p>
      <p class="muted">Also model: <a href="/sell-property-cost-singapore.html">selling fees + SSD + net proceeds</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="rules">4) Decision Rules: Should You Use CPF or Cash?</h2>
    <p>
      There is no universal answer. Use these rules to avoid regret:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>If liquidity is tight</strong>, using CPF can protect your cash buffer today — but expect lower cash-out later.</li>
      <li><strong>If you plan to upgrade soon</strong>, overusing CPF can reduce your cash proceeds, making the next downpayment harder.</li>
      <li><strong>If your mortgage rate is high</strong>, consider whether cash prepayment beats your realistic investment return.</li>
      <li><strong>If you care about cash at sale</strong>, using more cash (and less CPF) can increase cash-out — but only if you can afford it safely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
    <h3>Why did my sale proceeds “disappear” after selling my flat/condo?</h3>
    <p>Because CPF used for the property (downpayment + instalments) must be refunded to your CPF OA with accrued interest before you receive the remaining cash proceeds.</p>

    <h3>What exactly is CPF accrued interest?</h3>
    <p>CPF treats property use as if your OA funds had stayed in CPF earning OA interest. At sale, you refund the principal used plus the accrued interest that would have been earned.</p>

    <h3>Does CPF accrued interest mean I’m losing money?</h3>
    <p>Not necessarily. It often feels like a loss because it reduces cash-out, but it is essentially restoring your CPF balance (principal + interest) rather than paying an extra external fee.</p>

    <h3>Should I use more cash and less CPF for my property?</h3>
    <p>It depends on liquidity, expected returns, and risk tolerance. Using CPF preserves cash today but can reduce future cash-out at sale; using cash can increase liquidity at sale but may reduce current buffers.</p>
