<h1>The Real Cost of Owning a Rental Property</h1>

<p><em>Last updated: February 2026</em></p>

<p>
Rental property ownership is often perceived as passive income. In reality, it is a capital-intensive commitment involving acquisition cost, financing risk, recurring expenses and opportunity cost.
</p>

<p>
This article outlines the universal cost framework of rental property ownership. Singapore (2026 market conditions) is used as an example dataset, but the structure applies globally.

Over five years, interest payments may accumulate to SGD $60,000–$120,000 depending on loan size and rate environment.

<h3>Vacancy & Risk Buffer</h3>
