    <h1>The Real Cost of Owning a Rental Property in Singapore (2026)</h1>

    <p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>
      Rental property ownership is often perceived as passive income. In reality, it is a capital-intensive commitment involving acquisition cost, financing risk, recurring expenses and opportunity cost.
    </p>

    <p>
      This article outlines the cost framework of rental property ownership using Singapore (2026 market conditions) as a working dataset.
      The structure is universal; only the inputs change.
    </p>

      Over five years, interest payments may accumulate to SGD $60,000–$120,000 depending on loan size and rate environment.
    </p>

    <h3>Maintenance & Management</h3>
    <p>

    <h3>Opportunity Cost</h3>
    <p>
