    <h1>Is 10-Year COE Renewal Worth It in Singapore? (2026 Financial Breakdown)</h1>

    <p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>
      When your COE is expiring, a 10-year renewal often <em>feels</em> cheaper than buying another car.
      But financially, it is a <strong>capital exposure decision</strong>:
      you are committing a large amount of money into a new depreciation runway — and you are also giving up PARF permanently (if eligible).

    <h2 id="what-it-means">1) What a 10-Year COE Renewal Actually Means</h2>

    <p>
      A 10-year COE renewal means you pay the <strong>Prevailing Quota Premium (PQP)</strong> at the point of renewal.
      That payment becomes your new COE runway for the next 10 years — and therefore your new depreciation base.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Think of it like this:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are converting a “car replacement decision” into a <strong>long-hold capital lock-in</strong>.</li>
        <li>The “price” you pay is not just PQP — it’s PQP + the opportunity costs and risks you carry.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">

      </p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="parf">2) PARF Forfeiture (The Hidden Cost)</h2>

    <p>
      If your car is PARF-eligible (typically below 10 years), you may be entitled to a PARF rebate if you scrap/export instead of renewing.
      Once you renew COE, you permanently forfeit that PARF rebate.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Simple lens</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Effective renewal exposure</strong> ≈ PQP + PARF you give up</li>
        <li>That “missing PARF” is real money you could have received.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        You don’t need perfect accuracy — you need to avoid excluding the biggest hidden trade-off.

    <h2 id="vs-5">3) 10-Year vs 5-Year COE Renewal</h2>

    <p>
      Most people choose 10 years because it <em>looks</em> cheaper per year.
      That can be true — but you’re also choosing a different risk profile.
    </p>

    <h2 id="vs-switch">4) Renew vs Switch Car (Used/New)</h2>

    <p>
      Renewal is not competing only against “buying a new car”.
      The most common rational alternative is switching into a <strong>lower-depreciation used car</strong> with a cleaner risk profile.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Compare these (same horizon):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Renew 10 years:</strong> PQP + PARF forfeiture + higher age/repair risk (spread over your holding period)</li>
        <li><strong>Switch used:</strong> depreciation per year + condition risk + resale liquidity</li>
        <li><strong>Switch new:</strong> higher capital commitment + new depreciation curve</li>

    <h2 id="when-sense">5) When 10-Year Renewal Makes Financial Sense</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mechanical stability:</strong> the car has a strong reliability history and predictable maintenance</li>
      <li><strong>Long holding intent:</strong> you realistically plan to hold for years (not “maybe sell soon”)</li>
      <li><strong>Liquidity strength:</strong> paying PQP won’t stress buffers or force debt decisions elsewhere</li>
      <li><strong>Certainty premium:</strong> you want stable transport and prefer “good enough” over optimisation</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="when-not">6) When It’s Financially Irrational</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rising repair exposure:</strong> you expect big-ticket wear/tear or reliability volatility</li>
      <li><strong>Large PARF at stake:</strong> forfeiting PARF materially worsens the effective cost</li>
      <li><strong>Thin buffers:</strong> renewal crowds out savings/investing and increases fragility</li>
      <li><strong>Unclear holding period:</strong> if you might exit soon, long lock-in becomes a risk, not a benefit</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="checklist">7) Final Checklist</h2>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>10-year renewal tends to be rational if:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can hold long enough to amortise the commitment</li>
        <li>Your car is stable (low probability of forced replacement)</li>
        <li>You have priced PARF forfeiture explicitly</li>
        <li>You still have strong liquidity buffers after renewal</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>It’s usually a mistake if:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are “making it work” by stretching liquidity</li>
        <li>You have high repair risk in the next 24–36 months</li>
        <li>You might need to exit under time pressure</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      Next step:
      read the master decision framework
      <a href="/coe-renewal-worth-it-singapore.html">here</a>,
      then anchor your assumptions using
      <a href="/car-ownership-cost.html">the 5-year cost model</a>
      and
      <a href="/monthly-cost-of-owning-a-car-singapore.html">the monthly model</a>.

    <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

    <h3>Is it cheaper to renew COE for 10 years or buy another car?</h3>
    <p>
      It depends on PQP, your car’s condition, and what you would switch into. Renewal can beat buying new if your car is stable,
      but can lose to switching into a lower-depreciation used car once you include PARF forfeiture and repair risk.
    </p>

    <h3>Do you lose PARF if you renew COE for 10 years?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. Renewing COE forfeits your PARF rebate permanently (if eligible). Treat this as part of your effective renewal cost.
    </p>

    <h3>Is 10-year renewal better than 5-year renewal?</h3>
    <p>
      10-year renewal often reduces annualised cost but increases lock-in and long-term repair exposure. If you want shorter commitment,
      compare against: <a href="/5-year-coe-renewal-worth-it-singapore.html">5-year renewal</a>.
