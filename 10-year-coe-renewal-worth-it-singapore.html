<h1>Is 10-Year COE Renewal Worth It in Singapore? (2026 Financial Breakdown)</h1>

<p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

<p>
When your COE is expiring, renewing for 10 years feels cheaper than buying a new car.
But financially, it is a structural capital decision — not just a cost decision.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>1) What 10-Year COE Renewal Actually Means</h2>

<p>
A 10-year COE renewal requires paying the Prevailing Quota Premium (PQP) at the time of renewal.
</p>

<p>
If PQP is $90,000, you pay $90,000 upfront.
That becomes your new 10-year depreciation base.
</p>

<p>
Unlike a 5-year renewal, a 10-year renewal:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Cannot be extended again</li>
<li>Forfeits your PARF rebate permanently</li>
<li>Resets depreciation cycle for 10 years</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>2) The PARF Loss (The Hidden Cost)</h2>

<p>
If your car is under 10 years old, you may be entitled to a PARF rebate.
</p>

<p>
Renewing for 10 years eliminates that rebate permanently.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>PARF rebate: $12,000</li>
<li>PQP: $90,000</li>
</ul>

<p>
Your effective commitment is not $90,000.
It is $102,000 of capital exposure.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>3) 10-Year vs 5-Year COE Renewal</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Factor</th>
<th>5-Year Renewal</th>
<th>10-Year Renewal</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Upfront Cost</td>
<td>Lower</td>
<td>Higher</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Extension Possible</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PARF Loss</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Annualised Depreciation</td>
<td>Higher per year</td>
<td>Lower per year</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
10-year renewal lowers annualised depreciation but increases long-term lock-in.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>4) 10-Year Renewal vs Buying a Used Car</h2>

<p>
Sometimes switching to a lower depreciation used car creates better capital efficiency.
</p>

<p>
Compare:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Renewal depreciation per year</li>
<li>Used car depreciation per year</li>
<li>Repair risk difference</li>
<li>Liquidity flexibility</li>
</ul>

<p>
If used car depreciation is lower, renewal may not be optimal.
</p>

</p>

<hr>

<h2>5) 10-Year Renewal vs Buying New</h2>

<p>
Buying new introduces:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Higher capital commitment</li>
<li>New PARF lifecycle</li>
<li>Higher depreciation curve</li>
</ul>

<p>
If COE cycle is at peak, renewal may dominate new purchase financially.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>6) When 10-Year Renewal Makes Financial Sense</h2>

<ul>
<li>Car is mechanically stable</li>
<li>Low major repair risk</li>
<li>COE cycle relatively moderate</li>
<li>You want stability over optimisation</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>7) When It Is Financially Irrational</h2>

<ul>
<li>High upcoming repair exposure</li>
<li>PARF rebate is large relative to PQP</li>
<li>COE cycle extremely high</li>
<li>You are over-leveraged</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Final Perspective</h2>

<p>
Renewing COE for 10 years is not “cheap”.
It is committing to a new 10-year capital exposure.
