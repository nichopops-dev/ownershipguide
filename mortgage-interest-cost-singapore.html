    <p>
      Most buyers compare properties using monthly instalment.
      That’s the wrong anchor.
      The correct question is:
      <strong>how much interest will you transfer to the bank over your holding period (and over the full tenure if you keep it)?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      In Singapore, this matters because property is typically a <strong>leveraged capital allocation</strong> decision.
      Small rate moves change the total interest number enough to flip “good deal” to “fragile decision”.

    <h2 id="what">1) What “Interest Cost” Really Means</h2>

    <p>
      Your monthly payment contains two parts:
      <strong>principal</strong> (you’re paying yourself back) and <strong>interest</strong> (you’re paying the bank).
      Over long tenures, the total interest paid can be large even if the monthly payment looks “affordable”.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mental model:
      <strong>interest is the carrying cost of leverage</strong>.
      You are paying for the ability to control an asset with borrowed capital.
    </p>

    <h2 id="holding">2) Holding Period vs Full Tenure (Don’t Mix These)</h2>

    <p>
      Many people accidentally compare the wrong numbers:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Holding period view (e.g., 5 years):</strong> how much interest you pay during the years you actually hold the property.</li>
      <li><strong>Full tenure view (e.g., 25–30 years):</strong> how much interest you pay if you keep the loan running to the end.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted">
      If you’re deciding whether to buy now, use a consistent 5‑year window with friction included.
      Start with <a href="/property-ownership-cost-singapore.html">the 5-year exposure model</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="sensitivity">3) What a 0.5–1.0% Rate Move Does (Why It Matters)</h2>

    <p>
      Rate sensitivity is the silent killer.
      A 0.5% move can change total interest meaningfully.
      A 1.0% move can turn a “tight but okay” plan into a fragile one.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Stress-test rule</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Model your base case rate (what you think you’ll get today)</li>
        <li>Then stress +0.5% and +1.0%</li>
        <li>If +0.5% breaks your budget, the purchase is structurally fragile</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        This is why “can I afford the instalment today” is not enough.
        You need “can I survive realistic rate movement”.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="fixedfloat">4) Fixed vs SORA (Floating): Risk Framing</h2>

    <p>
      Don’t treat this as a prediction game.
      Treat it as <strong>risk transfer</strong>:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fixed:</strong> you buy certainty. Higher known cost is acceptable if your buffers are thin or cashflow is tight.</li>
      <li><strong>Floating (SORA-pegged):</strong> you might pay less at times, but you accept rate volatility risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The correct question is: <strong>how fragile is my plan to rate moves?</strong>
      If fragile, certainty is worth paying for.
    </p>

    <h2 id="prepay">5) When Early Repayment Makes Sense</h2>

    <p>
      Early repayment reduces total interest and reduces leverage risk.
      But it also reduces liquidity.
      The best plan is the one that leaves you resilient.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>More likely to make sense:</strong> high rate environment, thin buffers, high risk aversion, high leverage.</li>
      <li><strong>Less likely to make sense:</strong> you need liquidity, you have higher-return opportunities, or prepayment penalties are high.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted">
      If you’re buying for investment, also model vacancy and tenant risk:
      <a href="/rental-property-ownership-cost.html">Rental Property Ownership Cost</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="rules">6) Decision Rules (Simple, Non-Delusional)</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rule 1:</strong> Compare options over the same holding period (e.g., 5 years), not mixed time horizons.</li>
      <li><strong>Rule 2:</strong> Always stress-test +0.5% and +1.0% interest rates.</li>
      <li><strong>Rule 3:</strong> Don’t sacrifice liquidity to “win” a downpayment number. Cash buffer is survival.</li>
      <li><strong>Rule 4:</strong> Use interest + friction + opportunity cost as the real cost, not instalment alone.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

    <h3>How much mortgage interest will I pay over 25–30 years in Singapore?</h3>
    <p>
      It depends on loan size, interest rate path, and tenure.
      For many purchases, total interest over 25–30 years can be a six‑figure to mid six‑figure number.
      Stress-test different rates to see the range.
    </p>

    <h3>Does a lower monthly instalment mean the loan is cheaper?</h3>
    <p>
      Not necessarily.
      Lower instalments often come from longer tenure, which can increase total interest paid.
      Compare total interest and friction over a consistent time window.
    </p>

    <h3>Should I repay my mortgage early?</h3>
    <p>
      It can reduce interest cost and risk, but it reduces liquidity.
      It tends to make sense when your mortgage rate is meaningfully above your realistic after-risk return and you still keep a strong buffer.
    </p>

    <h3>Is SORA (floating) always better than fixed?</h3>
    <p>
      No.
      Fixed buys certainty.
      Floating can be cheaper at times but transfers rate risk to you.
      Choose based on buffer strength and stress-test tolerance.
