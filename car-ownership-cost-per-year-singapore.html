<p>
The average cost to own a car in Singapore is typically between 
<strong>$24,000 to $42,000 per year</strong>, depending on car type, COE cycle, and usage.
</p>

<p>
That translates to roughly <strong>$2,000 to $3,500+ per month</strong> in true economic cost terms.

<tr>
<th>Profile</th>
<th>Estimated Annual Cost</th>

<tr>
<td>Lower exposure (smaller car, lower COE cycle)</td>
<td>$24,000 – $28,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mid exposure (typical Cat A/B range)</td>
<td>$30,000 – $36,000</td>

<h2>What Makes Up the Annual Cost?</h2>

<h3>1) Depreciation (Largest Component)</h3>

<p>
Depreciation — largely driven by COE decay — usually accounts for the biggest share of annual cost.
In many profiles, this alone ranges between <strong>$15,000–$25,000 per year</strong>.
</p>

<p>
See:
<a href="/coe-cost-singapore.html">COE Cost in Singapore (2026)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) Insurance</h3>

<p>
Insurance typically ranges from $1,200 to $3,000+ per year depending on driver profile.
</p>

</p>

<h3>3) Fuel</h3>

<p>
Fuel costs vary by usage, but many drivers spend $2,500–$4,000 annually.
</p>

<h3>4) Maintenance & Repairs</h3>

<p>
Routine servicing and wear-and-tear often range $1,000–$3,000 per year,
with higher variability for older vehicles.
</p>

<h3>5) Parking & ERP</h3>

<p>
Season parking + workplace parking + ERP can add $2,000–$5,000 annually.

<h2>Why Annual Framing Can Be Misleading</h2>

<p>
Looking only at annual cost hides two key risks:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Liquidity commitment</strong> (upfront capital tied into COE + downpayment)</li>
<li><strong>Cycle timing risk</strong> (buying during high COE cycle amplifies exposure)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Annual Cost vs Ride-Hailing</h2>

<p>
If your annual ride-hailing spend exceeds ~$30,000–$36,000,
ownership may begin to make rational sense.

<h2>Final Perspective</h2>

<p>
Owning a car in Singapore typically costs the equivalent of a mid-level annual salary increment.
