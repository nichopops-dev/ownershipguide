    <h1>TDSR &amp; MSR in Singapore: The Real Borrowing Limit (Not Your Instalment)</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>
      Most buyers ask: “What instalment can I afford?”
      Banks ask: “How much debt can you carry under <strong>TDSR</strong> (and sometimes <strong>MSR</strong>) using a stress-tested rate?”
      This page is the practical bridge between those two questions.

    <h2 id="tdsr">1) TDSR: The Bank’s Constraint</h2>
    <p>
      TDSR is a cap on total debt repayments as a proportion of your gross monthly income.
      The key detail: banks don’t just use the promo rate you see today — they apply a <strong>stress-tested rate</strong>,
      and they include your <strong>existing debts</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="muted">
      Ownership Guide framing: <strong>TDSR is a liquidity gate</strong>. Your long-run cost is still driven by interest exposure and exit friction.
    </p>

    <h2 id="msr">2) MSR: The Extra Cap (Mostly HDB / EC)</h2>
    <p>
      MSR is an additional mortgage-only cap that applies mainly to HDB loans and Executive Condominiums.
      If it applies to your purchase, MSR can become the tighter constraint even when TDSR looks fine.
    </p>

    <h2 id="why">3) Why Banks Approve Less Than You Expect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Variable income haircut:</strong> bonuses, commissions, allowances may be discounted.</li>
      <li><strong>Existing debt inclusion:</strong> credit cards, car loans, student loans, other mortgages.</li>
      <li><strong>Stress rate:</strong> approvals are modelled with a higher assumed interest rate.</li>
      <li><strong>Tenure and age limits:</strong> reduce maximum loan even if you can pay more monthly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is why “my monthly instalment looks ok” is not the same as “the bank will lend me that amount”.
    </p>

    <h2 id="moves">4) What To Do If You’re Capped</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reduce debts first:</strong> pay down revolving/short-term debt to free up capacity.</li>
      <li><strong>Document income cleanly:</strong> stable payslips and tax assessments often matter more than claimed income.</li>
      <li><strong>Increase downpayment:</strong> reduces required loan and therefore the ratio constraints.</li>
      <li><strong>Choose a lower price band:</strong> avoid stretching to the maximum and losing buffer.</li>
      <li><strong>Plan for interest drag:</strong> see <a href="/mortgage-interest-cost-singapore.html">mortgage interest exposure</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="rules">5) Practical Decision Rules</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <ul>
        <li>If your plan requires “maxing out” TDSR/MSR, you are running a <strong>thin-buffer strategy</strong>.</li>
        <li>If a 1% rate rise breaks your cashflow, you should re-size the purchase or rebuild buffer before buying.</li>
        <li>TDSR/MSR approval is just the gate — the real ownership risk is the full stack: <a href="/bsd-absd-singapore.html">duties</a> · <a href="/renovation-cost-singapore.html">reno</a> · <a href="/sell-property-cost-singapore.html">exit costs</a> · <a href="/cpf-accrued-interest-singapore.html">CPF refund reality</a>.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
    <h3>Does MSR apply to condos?</h3>
    <p>Typically no — MSR mainly applies to HDB loans and Executive Condominiums. TDSR still applies broadly.</p>

    <h3>Should I buy at my maximum approved loan?</h3>
    <p>Usually not. The maximum approval often leaves you with thin liquidity, especially after duties, renovation, and future rate changes.</p>

    <h3>Is TDSR the same as my monthly affordability?</h3>
    <p>No. TDSR is a bank constraint using stress assumptions. Your real affordability must also include life expenses and buffer planning.</p>
