    <h1>Editorial Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">How we publish calculators and decision guides (Singapore). Last updated: 1 Mar 2026</p>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Plain English:</strong> we build <em>planning models</em> so you can make better decisions faster. They are educational tools, not personalised financial, legal, tax, or investment advice.</p>
    </div>

    <hr />

    <h2>What we publish (and what we avoid)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Decision guides:</strong> frameworks for high‑commitment choices (car ownership, property, financing).</li>
      <li><strong>Calculators:</strong> transparent models that convert complex rules into a small set of inputs and outputs.</li>
      <li><strong>We avoid duplicates:</strong> if a new page overlaps an existing one, we upgrade the existing page instead.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we build models</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>First principles:</strong> model the cashflows and constraints (duties, fees, financing caps, CPF mechanics).</li>
      <li><strong>Assumption transparency:</strong> every calculator should state what it assumes, what it ignores, and when it breaks.</li>
      <li><strong>Conservative sanity checks:</strong> we encourage readers to run a downside scenario before committing.</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretation help:</strong> calculators are paired with explanatory notes, examples, common mistakes, and FAQs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sources</h2>
    <p>
      Where official sources exist, we prefer them. Examples include IRAS (stamp duties), CPF Board (CPF usage and accrued
      interest mechanics), and HDB guidance for policy constraints. We may also reference bank documents for rate structure
      conventions and market practice (e.g., effective vs flat rates).
    </p>

    <h2>Updates and maintenance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We update pages when policy rules change, when calculators need clarification, or when readers report issues.</li>
      <li>Many pages include a <strong>“Last updated”</strong> line to make review cycles visible.</li>
      <li>We prioritise fixes that change decision outcomes (e.g., wrong rates, missing fees) over cosmetic changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Corrections policy</h2>
    <p>
      If you spot an error, email us at <a href="mailto:contact@ownershipguide.com">contact@ownershipguide.com</a> with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the page URL,</li>
      <li>what you entered (inputs) and what you expected, and</li>
      <li>the official source link (if relevant).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We verify against primary sources where possible and ship a versioned update. If the change is material, we note it
      on the relevant page.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising and independence</h2>
    <p>
      Ownership Guide may display ads (including Google AdSense) to support operating costs.
      Ads do not influence calculator assumptions or editorial conclusions.
