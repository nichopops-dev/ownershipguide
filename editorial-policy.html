    <h1>Editorial policy</h1>
    <p class="lead">Ownership Guide is a model‑driven site. We publish calculators and decision guides for Singapore ownership choices (transport, property, financing). This page explains how we create, maintain, and review content.</p>

<h2>What we mean by “planning model”</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Calculators here are built for <strong>decision planning</strong>: quick, transparent, conservative by default.</li>
  <li>They are not legal, tax, or financial advice. Final numbers depend on your bank, lawyer, agent, and official computations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How we build calculators</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>First principles:</strong> We model cashflows and constraints (loan caps, duties, fees) in a way users can understand.</li>
  <li><strong>Assumption transparency:</strong> Each calculator includes assumptions, a worked example, and common pitfalls.</li>
  <li><strong>Conservative mode:</strong> When uncertain, we recommend users test a conservative scenario.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sources and updates</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Where possible, we reference official sources (e.g., IRAS for stamp duty, CPF Board for CPF refund mechanics).</li>
  <li>We update calculators when rules or common market conventions change, and we mark pages with a “Last updated” date.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quality checks</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Link integrity:</strong> we run sweeps to avoid broken links and duplicated paths.</li>
  <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> shared UI components (buttons, cards, headers/footers) are kept consistent site‑wide.</li>
  <li><strong>Duplication control:</strong> we prefer upgrading existing pages rather than creating overlapping topics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>If you spot an error or want a new calculator, contact us via the <a href="/contact.html">contact page</a>. Include the page URL and what you expected to see.</p>
