<h1>Editorial policy</h1>
<p class="lead">Ownership Guide is a model‑driven site. We publish calculators and decision guides for Singapore ownership choices (transport, property, financing). This page explains how we create, maintain, and review content.</p>
<h2>What we mean by “planning model”</h2>
<ul>
<li>Calculators here are built for <strong>decision planning</strong>: quick, transparent, conservative by default.</li>
<li>They are not legal, tax, or financial advice. Final numbers depend on your bank, lawyer, agent, and official computations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How we build calculators</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>First principles:</strong> We model cashflows and constraints (loan caps, duties, fees) in a way users can understand.</li>
<li><strong>Assumption transparency:</strong> Each calculator includes assumptions, a worked example, and common pitfalls.</li>
<li><strong>Conservative mode:</strong> When uncertain, we recommend users test a conservative scenario.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sources and updates</h2>
<ul>
<li>Where possible, we reference official sources (e.g., IRAS for stamp duty, CPF Board for CPF refund mechanics).</li>
<li>We update calculators when rules or common market conventions change, and we mark pages with a “Last updated” date.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Quality checks</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Link integrity:</strong> we run sweeps to avoid broken links and duplicated paths.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency:</strong> shared UI components (buttons, cards, headers/footers) are kept consistent site‑wide.</li>
<li><strong>Duplication control:</strong> we prefer upgrading existing pages rather than creating overlapping topics.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>If you spot an error or want a new calculator, contact us via the <a href="/contact.html">contact page</a>. Include the page URL and what you expected to see.</p>

<h2>How we decide what to publish</h2>
<p>We prioritise pages that help Singapore readers make expensive decisions with clear numbers: property affordability, cash + CPF planning, stamp duties, mortgage mechanics, and car total cost of ownership.</p>
<h2>Quality checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unique purpose:</strong> each page answers one specific question; we avoid duplicates.</li>
<li><strong>Explicit assumptions:</strong> rates, horizons, and cost items are stated clearly.</li>
<li><strong>Worked examples:</strong> we include at least one example so readers can sanity‑check outputs.</li>
<li><strong>References:</strong> where official sources exist (IRAS, CPF Board, HDB), we link to them.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> we update calculators when policy/rates change, and we log “last updated”.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advertising disclosure</h2>
<p>Ownership Guide may show ads via Google AdSense. Ads do not influence our editorial decisions or calculator assumptions. See: <a href="/advertising-disclosure.html">Advertising Disclosure</a>.</p>
<p class="og-last-updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2026-02-28</p>
<h2>How we avoid “thin content”</h2>
<p>Tools alone are not enough. Every calculator is paired with explanatory content: assumptions, worked examples, common mistakes and FAQs. This helps readers use outputs correctly and makes pages useful even when you don’t run the calculator.</p>
<h2>Corrections</h2>
<p>If you find an error, contact us with the page URL and the official source. We review and update quickly, and we note major changes in the page’s “last updated” section.</p>

<h2>Sources we rely on</h2>
<ul>
<li>IRAS (stamp duties, property transaction taxes)</li>
<li>CPF Board (CPF usage and accrued interest mechanics)</li>
<li>HDB and bank documents for HDB vs bank loan comparisons</li>
</ul>
