    <h1>Cost of Owning a Car in Singapore (2026): 5-Year Depreciation & Full Breakdown</h1>

    <p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>
      Owning a car in Singapore is not a monthly instalment decision.
      It is a <strong>multi-year capital allocation commitment</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The correct way to think about ownership is a
      <strong>5-year total exposure model</strong> —
      not just fuel and loan payments.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you prefer a monthly realism view, see:
      <a href="/monthly-cost-of-owning-a-car-singapore.html">True Monthly Cost of Owning a Car in Singapore</a>.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1) The Full 5-Year Cost Structure</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Depreciation (including COE decay)</strong></li>
      <li>Loan interest (if financed)</li>
      <li>Insurance</li>
      <li>Fuel</li>
      <li>Maintenance & repairs</li>
      <li>Parking & ERP</li>
      <li>Opportunity cost of upfront capital</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Ignoring any one of these leads to a distorted ownership decision.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2) The Cost Engine: Depreciation & COE</h2>

    <p>
      Depreciation is usually the largest cost.
      In Singapore, COE is embedded inside that depreciation.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want the structural explanation of how COE drives cost:
      <a href="/coe-cost-singapore.html">COE Cost in Singapore (2026)</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A mass-market car may cost $120,000–$180,000 inclusive of COE.
      Over 5 years, depreciation commonly ranges:
    </p>

    <p><strong>$70,000 – $110,000</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <h2>3) Financing Cost (If You Take a Loan)</h2>

    <p>
      Financing adds interest drag.
      Over 5 years, total interest may range:
    </p>

    <p><strong>$10,000 – $30,000</strong></p>

    <p>
      Remember: flat rate ≠ real borrowing cost.
      See:
      <a href="/car-loan-rates-singapore.html">Car Loan Rates (Flat vs Effective Interest)</a>.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>4) Insurance</h2>

    <p>
      Comprehensive insurance typically costs:
    </p>

    <p><strong>$7,500 – $12,500 over 5 years</strong></p>

    <p>
      See realistic ranges:

    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>5) Fuel</h2>

    <p>
      Fuel depends on mileage, but commonly totals:
    </p>

    <p><strong>$12,000 – $18,000 over 5 years</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <h2>6) Maintenance & Repairs</h2>

    <p>
      Routine servicing + wear-and-tear:
    </p>

    <p><strong>$8,000 – $15,000 over 5 years</strong></p>

    <p class="muted">
      Older cars increase volatility.
      See:
      <a href="/used-car-vs-new-car-singapore.html">Used vs New Car Comparison</a>.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>7) Parking & ERP</h2>

    <p>
      Season parking + workplace parking + ERP:
    </p>

    <p><strong>$9,000 – $20,000 over 5 years</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <h2>8) Opportunity Cost of Capital</h2>

    <p>
      If $30,000–$50,000 is committed upfront
      and assumed at 5% annual return,
      opportunity cost over 5 years:
    </p>

    <p><strong>$7,500 – $15,000+</strong></p>

    <h2>10) When Car Ownership Makes Financial Sense</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Ride-hailing spend consistently ~$2,500–$3,000+ per month</li>
      <li>Schedule-critical logistics (family, irregular hours)</li>
      <li>Strong liquidity buffer</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Perspective</h2>

    <p>
      In Singapore, a car behaves like a leveraged lifestyle asset:
      it magnifies convenience —
      and magnifies financial fragility if mispriced.
    </p>

    <p>
      The correct decision is not “Can I afford the instalment?”
      It is:
      <strong>Does ownership outperform alternatives after pricing full 5-year exposure?</strong>
    </p>
