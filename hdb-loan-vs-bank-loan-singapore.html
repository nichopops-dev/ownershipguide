    <div class="og-hero">
      <p>This is not a “which rate is lower today” choice. It’s: <strong>how much rate risk you can survive</strong> and whether the eligibility and downpayment constraints fit your plan.</p>

      <h3>Decision checklist</h3>
      <ul class="og-checklist">
        <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Do you qualify for HDB loan (and does your flat’s lease/income profile fit)?</li>
        <li><strong>Buffer:</strong> Can you handle a +1–2% rate shock without changing your life?</li>
        <li><strong>Downpayment:</strong> Do you have the upfront cash/CPF needed if bank LTV is lower?</li>
        <li><strong>Horizon:</strong> Will you likely refinance within 2–3 years, or hold steady?</li>
        <li><strong>Psychology:</strong> Do you want predictability, or are you comfortable managing rate cycles?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="og-card">
      <h3>Worked example (illustrative)</h3>
      <div class="og-card-meta">Assume a $600k loan over 25 years. Numbers rounded; fees and exact rates vary by bank and period.</div>
      <table class="og-table">

    <h2>HDB loan vs bank loan: what actually matters</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Interest-rate risk:</strong> HDB loan is historically more stable (pegged to CPF OA), bank loans can move fast.</li>
        <li><strong>Downpayment:</strong> Bank loans often require more cash/CPF upfront (lower LTV), HDB loan can be higher LTV if you qualify.</li>
        <li><strong>Approval constraints:</strong> HDB loan eligibility rules can be the real bottleneck (income/ownership/remaining lease).</li>
        <li><strong>Optionality:</strong> Bank loans give you more refinancing options; HDB loan is simpler but less flexible.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Decision rules (simple, usable)</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose HDB loan</strong> if you need <em>maximum stability</em>, smaller buffers, and you qualify comfortably.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose bank loan</strong> if you have <em>buffers</em>, you want flexibility, and the rate gap is meaningful after fees.</li>
        <li>If you’re stretching TDSR/MSR, focus less on rate forecasts and more on <strong>fragility</strong>: what happens if rates + expenses spike together?</li>
      </ul>
