      <p>This is not a “which rate is lower today” choice. It’s: <strong>how much rate risk you can survive</strong> and whether the eligibility and downpayment constraints fit your plan.</p>

      <h3>Decision checklist</h3>
      <ul class="og-checklist">
        <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Do you qualify for HDB loan (and does your flat’s lease/income profile fit)?</li>
        <li><strong>Buffer:</strong> Can you handle a +1–2% rate shock without changing your life?</li>
        <li><strong>Downpayment:</strong> Do you have the upfront cash/CPF needed if bank LTV is lower?</li>
        <li><strong>Horizon:</strong> Will you likely refinance within 2–3 years, or hold steady?</li>
        <li><strong>Psychology:</strong> Do you want predictability, or are you comfortable managing rate cycles?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="og-card">
      <h3>Worked example (illustrative)</h3>
      <div class="og-card-meta">Assume a $600k loan over 25 years. Numbers rounded; fees and exact rates vary by bank and period.</div>
      <table class="og-table">
        <thead><tr><th>Option</th><th>Rate assumption</th><th>Monthly instalment</th><th>What to watch</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>HDB loan</td><td>2.6% stable</td><td>≈ $2,720</td><td>Lower shock risk; fewer refinance levers</td></tr><tr><td>Bank (promo)</td><td>2.0% for 2 years</td><td>≈ $2,540</td><td>Lock-in + what happens after promo</td></tr><tr><td>Bank (post-promo)</td><td>3.5% thereafter</td><td>≈ $3,000</td><td>This is the fragility test, not the promo</td></tr>

    <h2>HDB loan vs bank loan: what actually matters</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Interest-rate risk:</strong> HDB loan is historically more stable (pegged to CPF OA), bank loans can move fast.</li>
        <li><strong>Downpayment:</strong> Bank loans often require more cash/CPF upfront (lower LTV), HDB loan can be higher LTV if you qualify.</li>
        <li><strong>Approval constraints:</strong> HDB loan eligibility rules can be the real bottleneck (income/ownership/remaining lease).</li>
        <li><strong>Optionality:</strong> Bank loans give you more refinancing options; HDB loan is simpler but less flexible.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Decision rules (simple, usable)</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose HDB loan</strong> if you need <em>maximum stability</em>, smaller buffers, and you qualify comfortably.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose bank loan</strong> if you have <em>buffers</em>, you want flexibility, and the rate gap is meaningful after fees.</li>
        <li>If you’re stretching TDSR/MSR, focus less on rate forecasts and more on <strong>fragility</strong>: what happens if rates + expenses spike together?</li>
      </ul>
