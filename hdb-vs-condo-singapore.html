  <h1>HDB vs Condo (Singapore, 2026)</h1>
  <p class="meta">Decision comparison · Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <div class="og-hero">
    <p>
      This isn’t just “condo appreciate more”.
      The real decision is: <strong>what lifestyle are you buying</strong>, and <strong>what fragility are you accepting</strong>.
    </p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="og-card">
      <h3>Decision checklist</h3>
      <ul class="og-checklist">
        <li><strong>Budget buffer:</strong> Are you buying the most you can, or what you can hold through shocks?</li>
        <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Downpayment + reno + taxes + emergency fund all accounted for?</li>
        <li><strong>Holding power:</strong> Can you hold 5–10 years without being forced to sell?</li>
        <li><strong>Non-financial:</strong> Location, space, school, privacy — what are you paying for?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>


  <h2>The clean decision rule</h2>
  <div class="box">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>HDB wins</strong> when you want <strong>low-regret stability</strong>: lower fixed outflow, less fee drag, and more liquidity for life (kids, business, investing).</li>
      <li><strong>Condo wins</strong> when you are explicitly buying <strong>privacy + facilities + location</strong> and you can pay for it without stretching (including bad rate years).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>What changes the math</h2>
  <table class="og-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Driver</th>
        <th>Usually favours</th>
        <th>Why</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Maintenance fees / fixed monthly overhead</td>
        <td>HDB</td>
        <td>Condo fixed costs reduce flexibility and compound over years.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Rate shock tolerance</td>
        <td>HDB (if tight)</td>
        <td>Stretch + rate shock is the fastest path to forced decisions.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Privacy / facilities / lifestyle value</td>
        <td>Condo</td>
        <td>If you truly use it, this is part of the “return”.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Liquidity for other goals (kids/business/investing)</td>
        <td>HDB</td>
        <td>Liquidity is optionality. Optionality is wealth.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

<h2>Worked example (illustrative)</h2>
<div class="box">
  <p class="muted">Two households can “qualify” for both — but only one choice may be survivable in a bad-rate year.</p>
  <table class="og-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>5-year view</th>
        <th>Resale HDB</th>
        <th>Condo</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Purchase price (example)</td>
        <td>$700k</td>
        <td>$1.4m</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Recurring fixed costs</td>
        <td>Lower town council + utilities baseline</td>
        <td>Maintenance fees (e.g. $350–$600/mo)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Rate shock impact</td>
        <td>Smaller absolute swing</td>
        <td>Larger absolute swing</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Liquidity leftover after housing</td>
        <td>Typically higher</td>
        <td>Typically lower</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Most common regret</strong></td>
        <td>“I wanted more privacy/location.”</td>
        <td>“I bought lifestyle but lived stressed.”</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p class="muted">The key is not “which grows more” — it’s whether the upgrade destroys optionality.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Condo regret:</strong> you bought lifestyle, but you’re living with financial stress (or you don’t use the lifestyle).</li>
    <li><strong>HDB regret:</strong> you wanted privacy/location badly enough that you keep re-litigating the choice.</li>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <div class="og-faq">
        <details>
          <summary>Is condo always a better investment?</summary>
          <p>No. The right comparison is risk-adjusted exposure: cashflow fragility, holding power, and the opportunity cost of capital.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Should I stretch for condo for lifestyle?</summary>
          <p>Only if you can still hold through downside scenarios. Stretching converts a lifestyle choice into a forced-sale risk.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What costs do people forget?</summary>
          <p>Maintenance fees, renovation, taxes/fees, and the buffer needed to survive vacancy or income dips.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What’s the clean decision rule?</summary>
          <p>Buy what you can hold through shocks. Optionality beats max leverage.</p>
