  <h1>HDB vs Condo (Singapore, 2026)</h1>
  <p class="meta">Decision comparison · Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <div class="og-hero">
    <p>
      This isn’t just “condo appreciate more”.
      The real decision is: <strong>what lifestyle are you buying</strong>, and <strong>what fragility are you accepting</strong>.
    </p>
    <div class="og-hero-actions">
      <a class="og-primary" href="/property-ownership-cost-singapore.html">Property exposure model</a>
      <a class="og-secondary" href="/property-affordability-calculator-singapore.html">Stress test affordability</a>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>The clean decision rule</h2>
  <div class="box">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>HDB wins</strong> when you want <strong>low-regret stability</strong>: lower fixed outflow, less fee drag, and more liquidity for life (kids, business, investing).</li>
      <li><strong>Condo wins</strong> when you are explicitly buying <strong>privacy + facilities + location</strong> and you can pay for it without stretching (including bad rate years).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>What changes the math</h2>
  <table class="og-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Driver</th>
        <th>Usually favours</th>
        <th>Why</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Maintenance fees / fixed monthly overhead</td>
        <td>HDB</td>
        <td>Condo fixed costs reduce flexibility and compound over years.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Rate shock tolerance</td>
        <td>HDB (if tight)</td>
        <td>Stretch + rate shock is the fastest path to forced decisions.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Privacy / facilities / lifestyle value</td>
        <td>Condo</td>
        <td>If you truly use it, this is part of the “return”.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Liquidity for other goals (kids/business/investing)</td>
        <td>HDB</td>
        <td>Liquidity is optionality. Optionality is wealth.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

<h2>Worked example (illustrative)</h2>
<div class="box">
  <p class="muted">Two households can “qualify” for both — but only one choice may be survivable in a bad-rate year.</p>
  <table class="og-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>5-year view</th>
        <th>Resale HDB</th>
        <th>Condo</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Purchase price (example)</td>
        <td>$700k</td>
        <td>$1.4m</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Recurring fixed costs</td>
        <td>Lower town council + utilities baseline</td>
        <td>Maintenance fees (e.g. $350–$600/mo)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Rate shock impact</td>
        <td>Smaller absolute swing</td>
        <td>Larger absolute swing</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Liquidity leftover after housing</td>
        <td>Typically higher</td>
        <td>Typically lower</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Most common regret</strong></td>
        <td>“I wanted more privacy/location.”</td>
        <td>“I bought lifestyle but lived stressed.”</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p class="muted">The key is not “which grows more” — it’s whether the upgrade destroys optionality.</p>

    <li><strong>HDB regret:</strong> you wanted privacy/location badly enough that you keep re-litigating the choice.</li>
