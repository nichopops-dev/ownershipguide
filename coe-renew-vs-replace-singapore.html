    <p>
      This decision is not “renewal is cheaper monthly”.
      It’s: <strong>what total exposure are you accepting for the next 5 years</strong> — and how much fragility you’re adding.

  <h2>The clean decision rule</h2>
  <div class="box">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Renew</strong> if you can get <strong>low regret exposure</strong>: predictable usage, manageable repair risk, and the post-renewal depreciation/COE cost per month is acceptable <em>even in a bad year</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Replace</strong> if renewal turns your next 3–5 years into <strong>fragility</strong>: high repair risk, high uncertainty, or you’re renewing to avoid admitting you bought the wrong structure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">If you’re undecided after reading, run the numbers — the break-even usually reveals itself.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Decision table (fast)</h2>
  <table class="og-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Signal</th>
        <th>Leans toward</th>
        <th>Why it matters</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Your usage is stable for 3–5 years</td>
        <td>Renew</td>
        <td>Renewal is a “commitment buyout”. Uncertainty is expensive.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Repair risk is rising / unpredictable</td>
        <td>Replace</td>
        <td>One major repair can erase the perceived renewal savings.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>You want to reduce COE timing risk</td>
        <td>Renew</td>
        <td>You lock your structure and avoid buying into a bad COE moment.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>You’re renewing because “selling now is painful”</td>
        <td>Replace</td>
        <td>Sunk cost bias. Don’t extend a mistake to avoid admitting it.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Cashflow looks fine but liquidity is thin</td>
        <td>Replace / downsize</td>
        <td>Fragility kills: the bad month forces a bad sale.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

<h2>Worked example (illustrative)</h2>
<div class="box">
  <p class="muted">A quick way to see the break-even is to compare “what you pay to keep this structure” vs “what you pay to switch structures”.</p>
  <table class="og-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>5-year view</th>
        <th>Renew COE</th>
        <th>Replace car</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>One-time decision cost</td>
        <td>COE renewal: $65,000</td>
        <td>Downpayment + fees: $45,000</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Expected depreciation / exposure</td>
        <td>$1,000/mo equivalent</td>
        <td>$1,350/mo equivalent</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Repair risk (buffer)</td>
        <td>$250/mo buffer</td>
        <td>$120/mo buffer</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>All-in monthly exposure</strong></td>
        <td><strong>$1,250/mo</strong></td>
        <td><strong>$1,470/mo</strong></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p class="muted">If the “renew” path only wins because you’re under-budgeting repairs or ignoring liquidity, it’s a false win.</p>

  <h2>Common failure mode</h2>
  <p>
    People renew COE to “avoid buying high” — then forget they are still buying a structure.
    If renewal pushes you into thin liquidity, you’re not safer — you’re <em>more trapped</em>.
