<p class="meta">Ownership Guide — Independent Singapore ownership decision engine</p>
<p>
      We welcome feedback, corrections, and thoughtful suggestions. If something feels confusing or inaccurate, we want to
      know — we ship versioned updates and keep references where primary sources exist.
    </p>
<h2>Email</h2>
<p>
      You can reach us at <a href="mailto:contact@ownershipguide.com">contact@ownershipguide.com</a>.
    </p>
<h2>What you can contact us about</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corrections:</strong> broken links, incorrect assumptions, outdated rates, or calculation edge cases.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback:</strong> which tools you want next, what’s confusing, what would make decisions easier.</li>
<li><strong>Partnerships / data sources:</strong> if you have official or primary sources we should reference.</li>
<li><strong>Technical issues:</strong> layout bugs, accessibility issues, or page errors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How we handle corrections</h2>
<p>
      When you report an issue, we verify against primary sources where possible (e.g., CPF, IRAS, HDB, MAS/LTA) and ship a
      versioned update. If a change is material, we add a note to the page.
    </p>
<h2>Before you email</h2>
<ul>
<li>Paste the page URL you’re referring to.</li>
<li>Tell us the numbers you entered (or attach a screenshot of inputs/outputs).</li>
<li>If you’re referencing a rule/rate, include the source link.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Important note</h2>
<p>
      Ownership Guide provides structured educational models and decision frameworks. We do not provide personalised
      financial, legal, tax, or investment advice.

<p>If you spot a mistake, a broken link, or a model assumption that should be clarified, please reach out. We take corrections seriously and will update pages when needed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corrections:</strong> include the page URL and what you believe is wrong (and a source if you have one).</li>
<li><strong>Partnerships/ads:</strong> we can consider relevant sponsorships, but <strong>ads do not influence conclusions</strong>. See our <a href="/advertising-disclosure.html">Advertising Disclosure</a>.</li>
<li><strong>General feedback:</strong> tell us what decision you were trying to make — it helps us prioritise new calculators and improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p class="muted">We’re Singapore-first and keep the site lightweight (static pages). If something fails to load, a screenshot helps.</p>
