<h1>Ownership Guide</h1>

<p class="meta">
Structured financial breakdowns of what ownership really costs in Singapore.
</p>

<p>

We model the full exposure — depreciation, capital commitment, liquidity risk and opportunity cost.

<h2>What This Site Does</h2>

<p>
Ownership Guide builds structured financial decision models for high-commitment purchases.
Each article follows a consistent framework:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Full cost structure</li>
<li>5-year exposure modelling</li>
<li>Liquidity and risk considerations</li>
<li>When it makes financial sense — and when it does not</li>
</ul>

<p>
We focus on Singapore first. The framework scales globally.
