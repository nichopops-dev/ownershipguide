<h1>Advertising Disclosure</h1>
<p>
        Ownership Guide may display advertising (for example via Google AdSense). Advertising helps support the site and keep
        the calculators free to use.
      </p>
<h2>How ads work on Ownership Guide</h2>
<p>
        If/when ads are shown on this site, they may be served by third‑party partners (e.g., Google AdSense) and may be
        personalised based on your browser settings. We do not control which specific ads you see on each visit.
      </p>
<h2>Ad placement</h2>
<p>
        Ad placement and frequency may vary over time. We do not ask users to click ads, and we avoid layouts that make ads
        look like navigation or tool controls.
      </p>
<h2>Affiliate links and sponsorships</h2>
<p>
        From time to time, we may include affiliate links or sponsored mentions. If we do, we will clearly disclose them on
        the relevant page. Our calculator assumptions and editorial content are not written to “sell” a product.
      </p>
<h2>Editorial independence</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ads do not influence our calculator assumptions, rankings, or conclusions.</li>
<li>We prefer decision clarity over clickbait.</li>
<li>We disclose assumptions and update pages when policies change.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cookies and data</h2>
<p>
        Advertising partners may use cookies or similar technologies to serve ads. For details, see our
        <a href="/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>
<h2>What we don’t do</h2>
<ul>
<li>We do not sell your personal data to advertisers.</li>
<li>We do not publish sponsored content without clear labeling.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>
        If you see an ad that appears misleading or inappropriate, tell us the page URL and a screenshot so we can report it
        through the appropriate channel.
      </p>

<h2 style="margin-top:0">What “ads” mean on OwnershipGuide.com</h2>
<p>We may display advertising (e.g., Google AdSense) to keep the site free. Ads help fund maintenance, hosting, and ongoing improvements to calculators and guides.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Independence:</strong> advertising does not determine what we publish or what our models conclude.</li>
<li><strong>No pay-to-rank:</strong> we do not sell “best of” rankings in exchange for payment.</li>
<li><strong>Affiliate links:</strong> if we ever add affiliate links, we will clearly disclose them on the page.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about how ads are displayed or want to report an inappropriate ad, use the <a href="/contact.html">contact page</a>.</p>
