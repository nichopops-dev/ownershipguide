<h1>Car vs Ride-Hailing Break-Even Calculator (Singapore)</h1>

<p><em>Last updated: February 2026</em></p>

<p>
This calculator estimates whether owning a car or relying on ride-hailing
is financially cheaper over a 5-year period in Singapore.

<h2>How This Comparison Works</h2>

<p>
For comparison, we use a mid-range 5-year Singapore car ownership model.
This benchmark reflects realistic costs for a typical Category A/B vehicle
under current COE conditions.
</p>

<p><strong>Estimated 5-Year Car Ownership Cost: $150,000</strong></p>

<p>
This estimate includes depreciation, COE, insurance, road tax,
maintenance, fuel, parking, and opportunity cost.
</p>
