  <h1>Car Loan Rates in Singapore (2026): Flat Rate vs EIR Explained Clearly</h1>

  <p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <p>
    Car loan rates in Singapore are usually advertised as <strong>1.98%</strong> or <strong>2.48%</strong>.
    These are <strong>flat rates</strong> — not your true borrowing cost.
  </p>

  <p>
    The real cost is reflected in the <strong>Effective Interest Rate (EIR)</strong>,
    which is typically <strong>1.8–2.2× higher</strong> than the quoted flat rate.
  </p>

  <h2 id="difference">1) Flat Rate vs EIR (The Core Difference)</h2>

  <p>
    Most Singapore car loans use a <strong>flat interest structure</strong>.
    Interest is calculated on the original principal for the entire tenure —
    not on a declining balance.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <p>$100,000 × 2.28% flat × 5 years = $11,400 total interest</p>
  </div>

  <p>
    Even though your outstanding principal reduces monthly,
    interest is still computed on the full original amount.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>EIR converts this into the real annualised borrowing cost.</strong>
  </p>

  <p class="muted">
    Rule of thumb:  
    2.0% flat ≈ ~3.7–4.0% EIR  
    2.5% flat ≈ ~4.5–4.8% EIR
  </p>

    Financing alone commonly adds <strong>$10,000–$15,000</strong> over five years.

  <h2 id="tenure">4) 5-Year vs 7-Year Loan (The Instalment Trap)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Longer tenure → lower instalment</strong></li>
    <li><strong>But higher total interest</strong></li>
    <li>Higher financing drag</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Lower instalment does not mean lower cost.
    It only spreads cost.
  </p>

  <p>
    If instalment thinking is driving your decision:

    </a>
  </p>

  <h2 id="exposure">5) Financing and Total Ownership Exposure</h2>

  <p>
    A car loan:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Reduces upfront capital commitment</li>
    <li>Increases total cost via interest</li>
    <li>Can magnify exit timing risk</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Always evaluate financing inside:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="/car-ownership-cost.html">5-Year Ownership Breakdown</a></li>
    <li><a href="/coe-cost-singapore.html">COE Structure</a></li>
    <li><a href="/how-much-salary-to-own-a-car-singapore.html">Salary Affordability</a></li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2 id="cash">6) Finance or Pay Cash?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>If expected investment return exceeds EIR, financing may be rational.</li>
    <li>If financing stretches liquidity, risk rises.</li>
    <li>If holding period is short (2–4 years), financing magnifies timing risk.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2 id="compare">7) How to Compare Loan Offers Properly</h2>

  Always compare:

  <ul>
    <li>Flat rate</li>
    <li>EIR</li>
    <li>Total interest paid</li>
    <li>Early repayment penalties</li>
    <li>Lock-in period</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The lowest flat rate is not automatically the lowest total cost.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Final Perspective</h2>

  <p>
    Financing does not reduce car cost —
    it reshapes it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The real decision is not:
    “Can I afford the instalment?”
  </p>

  <p>
    It is:
    <strong>Does financing still make ownership rational after pricing full 5-year exposure?</strong>
