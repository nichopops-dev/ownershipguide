<h1>Car Loan Rates in Singapore (2026): Flat Rate vs EIR Explained Clearly</h1>

<p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

<p>
Car loan rates in Singapore are usually advertised as <strong>1.98%</strong> or <strong>2.48%</strong>.
These are <strong>flat rates</strong> — not your true borrowing cost.
</p>

<p>
The real cost is reflected in the <strong>Effective Interest Rate (EIR)</strong>,
which is typically <strong>1.8–2.2× higher</strong> than the quoted flat rate.
</p>

<p>
If you are borrowing $100,000,
even a 0.5% difference in flat rate can mean
<strong>$2,000–$5,000 difference</strong> over five years.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>1) Flat Rate vs EIR (The Core Difference)</h2>

<p>
Most Singapore car loans use a <strong>flat interest structure</strong>.
Interest is calculated on the original principal for the entire loan tenure —
not on a declining balance.
</p>

<div class="box">
  <p><strong>Flat rate example:</strong></p>
  <p>
    $100,000 loan × 2.28% flat × 5 years  
    = $11,400 total interest
  </p>
</div>

<p>
Even though your outstanding principal reduces every month,
interest is still computed as if you owed the full amount.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>EIR</strong> converts this structure into the true annualised borrowing cost.
</p>

<p class="muted">
Rule of thumb:  
2.0% flat ≈ ~3.7–4.0% EIR  
2.5% flat ≈ ~4.5–4.8% EIR
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2) Typical Market Range (2026)</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Quoted Flat Rate</th>
<th>Approximate EIR</th>
<th>Profile</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1.68% – 1.98%</td>
<td>~3.1% – 3.8%</td>
<td>Promotional / strong credit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2.18% – 2.48%</td>
<td>~4.0% – 4.6%</td>
<td>Common approval range</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2.68% – 3.00%+</td>
<td>~4.8% – 5.5%+</td>
<td>Higher risk / weaker profile</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Actual approval depends on:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Credit history</li>
<li>Loan quantum</li>
<li>Car age</li>
<li>Tenure selected</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>3) 5-Year Loan Example ($100,000 Loan)</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flat Rate</th>
<th>Total Interest (5 Years)</th>
<th>Approx Monthly Instalment</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1.98%</td>
<td>~$9,900</td>
<td>~$1,830</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2.48%</td>
<td>~$12,400</td>
<td>~$1,870</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2.98%</td>
<td>~$14,900</td>
<td>~$1,910</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Financing alone commonly adds <strong>$10,000–$15,000</strong> over five years.
</p>

<p>
That cost sits on top of:
<a href="/car-ownership-cost.html">depreciation</a>,
insurance, fuel and maintenance.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>4) 5-Year vs 7-Year Loan (The Instalment Trap)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Longer tenure → lower monthly instalment</strong></li>
<li><strong>But higher total interest paid</strong></li>
<li>Financing drag increases</li>
</ul>

<p>
Lower instalment does not mean lower cost.
It only spreads cost over a longer period.
</p>

<h2>5) Financing and Total Ownership Exposure</h2>

<p>
A car loan changes two things:
</p>

<ul>
<li>It reduces upfront capital commitment</li>
<li>It increases total cost via interest</li>
</ul>

<p>
You must evaluate financing inside the full 5-year model:
</p>

<li><a href="/car-ownership-cost.html">5-Year Ownership Breakdown</a></li>
<li><a href="/coe-cost-singapore.html">COE Cost Structure</a></li>
<li><a href="/how-much-salary-to-own-a-car-singapore.html">Salary Affordability Framework</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>6) Should You Finance or Pay Cash?</h2>

<ul>
<li>If your expected investment return exceeds your EIR, financing may be rational.</li>
<li>If financing stretches liquidity, risk rises.</li>
<li>If holding period is short (2–4 years), financing drag magnifies timing risk.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If your decision depends on whether the car is worth it at all:

</a>
</p>

<hr>

<h2>7) How to Compare Loan Offers Properly</h2>

Always compare:

<ul>
<li>Quoted flat rate</li>
<li>Effective interest rate (EIR)</li>
<li>Total interest over full tenure</li>
<li>Early repayment penalties</li>
<li>Lock-in period</li>
</ul>

<p>
The lowest advertised flat rate is not automatically the lowest total cost.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Final Perspective</h2>

<p>
In Singapore, financing does not reduce car cost —
it reshapes it.
</p>

<p>
The real decision is not:
“Can I afford the instalment?”
</p>

<p>
It is:
<strong>Does financing still make ownership rational after pricing full 5-year exposure?</strong>
