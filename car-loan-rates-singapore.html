<h1>Best Car Loan Rates in Singapore (2026): Flat Rate vs EIR Explained</h1>

<p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

<p>
Car loan rates in Singapore are commonly advertised as <strong>1.98%</strong> or <strong>2.48%</strong>.
These figures are <strong>flat rates</strong> — not the true borrowing cost.
</p>

<p>
The real cost is reflected in the <strong>Effective Interest Rate (EIR)</strong>,
which is usually <strong>1.8–2.2× higher</strong> than the quoted flat rate.
</p>

<p>
If you are financing a $100,000 car, even a 0.5% difference in flat rate can mean
<strong>$2,000–$5,000 difference</strong> over five years.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>1) How Car Loans Work in Singapore</h2>

<p>
Most Singapore car loans use a <strong>flat interest structure</strong>.
Interest is calculated on the original principal for the entire tenure,
instead of on a declining balance.
</p>

<p class="muted">
Example: A 2.28% flat rate may translate to ~4.2%–4.5% EIR.
</p>

<p>
This structure makes loans appear cheaper than they actually are.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2) Typical Car Loan Rate Ranges (2026)</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Quoted Flat Rate</th>
<th>Approximate EIR</th>
<th>Market Profile</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1.68% – 1.98%</td>
<td>~3.1% – 3.8%</td>
<td>Promotional / strong credit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2.18% – 2.48%</td>
<td>~4.0% – 4.6%</td>
<td>Common approval range</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2.68% – 3.00%+</td>
<td>~4.8% – 5.5%+</td>
<td>Higher risk profile</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Approval depends on credit history, car age, loan amount, and tenure.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>3) 5-Year Loan Cost Example ($100,000 Loan)</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flat Rate</th>
<th>Total Interest (5 Years)</th>
<th>Approx Monthly Instalment</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1.98%</td>
<td>~$9,900</td>
<td>~$1,830</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2.48%</td>
<td>~$12,400</td>
<td>~$1,870</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2.98%</td>
<td>~$14,900</td>
<td>~$1,910</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Financing alone may cost <strong>$10,000–$15,000</strong> over five years.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>4) 5-Year vs 7-Year Loan: What Changes?</h2>

<ul>
<li>7-year tenure lowers monthly instalment.</li>
<li>Total interest paid increases significantly.</li>
<li>Depreciation + financing drag becomes heavier.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Lower monthly instalment does not mean lower total cost.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>5) How Financing Affects Total Ownership Cost</h2>

<p>
Loan cost is only one layer of total exposure.
You must also account for:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Depreciation (COE decay)</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Fuel</li>
<li>Maintenance</li>
<li>Parking & ERP</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>6) Should You Finance or Pay Cash?</h2>

<ul>
<li>If your investment returns exceed EIR, financing may be rational.</li>
<li>If financing stretches liquidity, risk rises.</li>
<li>Short holding periods magnify financing drag.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Financing amplifies capital exposure. It does not reduce it.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>7) How to Compare Loan Offers Properly</h2>

Always compare:
<ul>
<li>Quoted flat rate</li>
<li>Effective interest rate (EIR)</li>
<li>Total interest over full tenure</li>
<li>Early repayment penalties</li>
<li>Lock-in period</li>
</ul>

<p>
The lowest advertised flat rate is not always the lowest total cost.
