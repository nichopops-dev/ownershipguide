    <h1>Property Ownership Cost in Singapore (2026): 5-Year Total Exposure Model (HDB + Condo)</h1>

    <p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>
      In Singapore, property is not mainly a “monthly mortgage” decision.
      It is a <strong>multi-year capital allocation commitment</strong> with
      <strong>interest sensitivity</strong>, <strong>liquidity lock-up</strong>, and <strong>exit risk</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The right way to evaluate buying is a <strong>5-year total exposure model</strong>:
      not just instalments, but the full ownership cost structure that survives even if your price prediction is wrong.
    </p>

    <div class="box">

    <h2 id="quick">Quick Answer (What This Model Actually Prices)</h2>

    <p>
      A clean 5-year ownership model prices:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Buyer costs:</strong> stamp duties + legal/valuation/admin (one-time friction)</li>
      <li><strong>Interest drag:</strong> the true cost of financing (rate sensitivity matters)</li>
      <li><strong>Ongoing costs:</strong> property tax, maintenance/MCST, insurance, repairs</li>
      <li><strong>Opportunity cost:</strong> what your downpayment/CPF/cash could have earned</li>
      <li><strong>Exit costs + exit risk:</strong> agent fees, legal fees, and price movement</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted">If you want to price buyer friction properly, read: <a href="/bsd-absd-singapore.html">BSD &amp; ABSD (stamp duty) explained</a>.</p>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>One-line rule:</strong> If you cannot hold long enough, <strong>exit friction dominates</strong>.</p>
      <p class="muted">
        This is why “I might sell in 2–3 years” is not a minor detail — it changes the entire math.

    <h2 id="formula">2) The Model (Simple, Non-Delusional)</h2>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>5-year total exposure</strong> ≈</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Buyer costs</strong></li>
        <li>+ <strong>Interest paid (5 years)</strong></li>
        <li>+ <strong>Ongoing costs (5 years)</strong></li>
        <li>+ <strong>Opportunity cost of upfront capital</strong></li>
        <li>+ <strong>Exit costs</strong></li>
        <li>± <strong>Price movement</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        Instalments include principal repayment, which is not a “cost” (it becomes equity).
        The cost is the drag/friction around the asset and the risk of needing to exit early.
      </p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="assumptions">3) Assumptions Used (So You Can Stress-Test)</h2>

    <p>
      This page uses a planning baseline consistent with Singapore reality:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Holding period:</strong> 5 years</li>
      <li><strong>Loan tenure:</strong> 25 years</li>
      <li><strong>Interest rate baseline:</strong> 3.5% (stress-test at 3.0% and 4.0%)</li>
      <li><strong>Example A (HDB resale):</strong> $800,000</li>
      <li><strong>Example B (Condo):</strong> $1.5M (your stated “average” band ~1.4–1.5M)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted">
      These are illustrative frameworks, not quotes. Your exact BSD, loan terms, and taxes differ.
      The point is structure: you should still be making a good decision after changing assumptions.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="examples">4) Worked Examples (HDB Resale vs Condo)</h2>

    <p>
      Below are simplified examples to illustrate what dominates cost.
      They are intentionally conservative and model-first (not sales brochure math).
    </p>

    <h3>Example A — $800k Resale HDB (5-year lens)</h3>
    <div class="box">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Buyer friction:</strong> BSD + legal/fees (one-time)</li>
        <li><strong>Interest drag (5 years):</strong> depends on loan size and rate</li>
        <li><strong>Ongoing (5 years):</strong> property tax + maintenance + repairs buffer</li>
        <li><strong>Opportunity cost:</strong> cash/CPF tied up</li>
        <li><strong>Exit friction:</strong> agent + legal selling fees</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        HDB typically has <strong>lower ongoing “building cost” friction</strong> vs condos (MCST),
        but still has real maintenance and tax costs, plus the same exit-risk logic.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Example B — $1.5M Condo (5-year lens)</h3>
    <div class="box">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Buyer friction:</strong> BSD is larger in absolute dollars</li>
        <li><strong>Ongoing (5 years):</strong> MCST/maintenance becomes a meaningful “always-on” cost</li>
        <li><strong>Liquidity lock-up:</strong> higher upfront commitment increases opportunity cost</li>
        <li><strong>Exit friction:</strong> selling costs are similar percentage-wise but larger absolute</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        Condos are more sensitive to “I might sell early” because absolute dollars are larger,
        and <strong>ongoing fixed costs don’t care about your timeline</strong>.
      </p>
    </div>

    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="sensitivity">5) Interest Rate Sensitivity (Why 0.5% Matters)</h2>

    <p class="muted">Want the long-horizon view of interest exposure (25–30 years) and what rate moves do to total interest? Read: <a href="/mortgage-interest-cost-singapore.html">Mortgage Interest Cost in Singapore</a>.</p>

    <p>
      Rate changes matter because they affect <strong>interest drag</strong> and your monthly cashflow.
      The model survives when you stress-test:
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Base:</strong> 3.5%</li>
        <li><strong>Lower:</strong> 3.0%</li>
        <li><strong>Higher:</strong> 4.0%</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        If 0.5% higher breaks the decision, your plan is fragile.
        A good ownership decision should survive realistic rate movement.
      </p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="exit">6) Exit Risk (Forced-Sale Penalties)</h2>

    <p>
      The biggest real-world risk is not “price goes down 1%”.
      It is: <strong>you need to sell earlier than planned</strong>.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Exit risk rule:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Short holds (1–2 years):</strong> friction dominates (buyer + seller costs get compressed)</li>
        <li><strong>Medium holds (3–5 years):</strong> still sensitive; do not assume smooth exit</li>
        <li><strong>Long holds (6–10 years):</strong> friction spreads out; decision becomes more resilient</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="muted">
      This is why “I might upgrade in 2–3 years” should be treated as a high-risk assumption, not a casual plan.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="checklist">7) Final Checklist (Buy vs Postpone)</h2>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Buy (or proceed) if:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can hold ~5 years without forcing a sale under stress</li>
        <li>You have buffers for higher interest / repairs / MCST increases (if condo)</li>
        <li>Your downpayment/CPF lock-up does not starve investing/emergency reserves</li>
        <li>You’re not deciding purely based on instalment affordability</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Postpone / restructure if:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your holding period is uncertain and you might exit early</li>
        <li>A 0.5% rate increase breaks your monthly cashflow</li>
        <li>You’re draining buffers to “make it work”</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

    <h3>How much does it cost to own a property in Singapore over 5 years?</h3>
    <p>
      The true 5-year cost is not just mortgage payments. It includes interest drag, buyer costs (BSD/fees),
      ongoing costs (tax/maintenance), opportunity cost of upfront capital, and exit costs—plus the risk of price movement.
      A disciplined model prices total exposure, not instalments.
    </p>

    <h3>Is buying a condo in Singapore still worth it in 2026?</h3>
    <p>
      It depends on holding period, interest sensitivity, and liquidity resilience. Condos often have higher entry friction
      and ongoing fixed costs (MCST), so you should decide using a 5-year exposure model, not instalment comfort.
      See: <a href="/condo-ownership-cost.html">condo ownership cost model</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the biggest mistake people make when evaluating property affordability?</h3>
    <p>
      Using instalments as the affordability metric. Instalments are a payment method. The true cost includes interest drag,
      taxes/fees, ongoing maintenance, opportunity cost of locked-up capital, and exit friction.
