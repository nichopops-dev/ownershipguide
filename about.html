    <h1>About Ownership Guide</h1>
    <p class="meta">Independent Singapore ownership decision models. Last updated: 1 Mar 2026</p>

    <p>
      Ownership Guide is an independent, model-driven website focused on the <strong>real cost of ownership</strong> in Singapore.
      We publish structured breakdowns for high-commitment decisions — especially where the biggest costs are hidden inside
      <strong>depreciation, liquidity impact, financing drag, and opportunity cost</strong>.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Core principle:</strong> monthly instalments are not the same as true cost.</p>
      <p class="muted">
        Most ownership mistakes happen because decisions are made using a single visible number (the monthly payment),
        while the real exposure sits in depreciation curves, COE timing, resale liquidity, and risk volatility.
      </p>

    <h2>What we cover</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Transport:</strong> car ownership exposure, COE mechanics, depreciation, insurance, and financing drag (including lease vs buy)</li>
      <li><strong>Property:</strong> buy vs rent, stamp duties, cash/CPF planning, loan constraints, refinance decisions, and sell → buy next workflows</li>
      <li><strong>Financing:</strong> amortisation, affordability checks, break-even analysis, and capital allocation trade-offs (pay down vs invest)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted">
      Singapore is the starting dataset because its ownership costs behave differently (COE, financing constraints, stamp duties, CPF rules, etc.).
      The modelling framework is designed to be extendable into new verticals over time.
    </p>

    <h2>How the models work</h2>
    <p>
      Each article is written as a decision framework. We aim to be <strong>transparent about assumptions</strong> and consistent in structure so pages are comparable.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cost structure mapping:</strong> what actually drives the decision</li>
      <li><strong>5-year exposure lens:</strong> total capital risk over time (not 1-month affordability)</li>
      <li><strong>Liquidity + volatility framing:</strong> what breaks in the real world (repairs, renewal jumps, cycle timing)</li>
      <li><strong>Decision checkpoints:</strong> clear gates to avoid common traps</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted">
      Figures shown are simplified planning models — not quotes. Always validate with current COE results, actual loan offers, insurer quotations, and legal advice where relevant.
    </p>
