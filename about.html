<h1>About Ownership Guide</h1>

<p class="meta">Structured ownership cost models for Singapore (2026).</p>

<p>
Ownership Guide is an independent, model-driven website focused on the <strong>real cost of ownership</strong> in Singapore.
We publish structured breakdowns for high-commitment decisions — especially where the biggest costs are hidden inside
<strong>depreciation, liquidity impact, financing drag, and opportunity cost</strong>.
</p>

<div class="box">
  <p><strong>Core principle:</strong> monthly instalments are not the same as true cost.</p>
  <p class="muted">
    Most ownership mistakes happen because decisions are made using a single visible number (the monthly payment),
    while the real exposure sits in depreciation curves, COE timing, resale liquidity, and risk volatility.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>What We Cover</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Transport:</strong> car ownership exposure, COE mechanics, insurance reality, financing drag, ride-hailing break-even</li>
  <li><strong>Property:</strong> ownership structures, acquisition + financing exposure, liquidity and opportunity cost</li>
  <li><strong>Capital allocation:</strong> trade-offs between committing capital vs preserving flexibility</li>
</ul>

<p class="muted">
Singapore is the starting dataset because its ownership costs behave differently (COE, financing constraints, stamp duties, etc.).
The modelling framework is designed to be extendable.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>How the Models Work</h2>

<p>
Each article is written as a decision framework. We aim to be <strong>transparent about assumptions</strong> and consistent in structure so pages are comparable.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cost structure mapping:</strong> what actually drives the decision</li>
  <li><strong>5-year exposure lens:</strong> total capital risk over time (not 1-month affordability)</li>
  <li><strong>Liquidity + volatility framing:</strong> what breaks in the real world (repairs, renewal jumps, cycle timing)</li>
  <li><strong>Decision checkpoints:</strong> clear gates to avoid common traps</li>
</ul>

<p class="muted">
Figures shown are simplified planning models — not quotes. Always validate with current COE results, actual loan offers, and insurer quotations.
</p>

    <h2>What this site is</h2>
    <p><strong>Ownership Guide</strong> is a Singapore “ownership decision engine”: we publish calculators and decision guides for transport, property, and financing choices. The goal is simple — turn confusing trade-offs into clear numbers.</p>

    <h2>How to interpret calculators</h2>
    <p>Most tools here are <em>planning models</em>. They make assumptions explicit so you can pressure-test scenarios quickly. For final numbers, confirm with your bank/lawyer/agent and official calculators.</p>

    <h2>How we maintain quality</h2>
    <ul class="og-bullets">
      <li>We prefer upgrading existing pages over creating overlapping topics.</li>
      <li>We add worked examples, assumptions, and FAQs to help you use outputs correctly.</li>
      <li>We keep references where official sources exist (IRAS, CPF Board, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
