<h1>About Ownership Guide</h1>

<p class="meta">Structured Ownership Cost Models for Singapore (2026)</p>

<p>
Ownership Guide is an independent financial modelling website focused on analysing the real cost of ownership in Singapore.
</p>

<p>
Many high-commitment financial decisions — such as buying a car or property — are evaluated using visible monthly payments.  
We instead model the full economic exposure.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>What We Analyse</h2>

<p>
Each breakdown focuses on:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Total capital exposure</li>
<li>Depreciation impact</li>
<li>Liquidity commitment</li>
<li>Opportunity cost of capital</li>
<li>Volatility and structural risk</li>
<li>Break-even comparisons (where applicable)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The goal is clarity — not persuasion.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Current Focus Areas</h2>

<ul>
<li>Car ownership in Singapore</li>
<li>Ride-hailing vs ownership comparisons</li>
<li>Property ownership structures</li>
<li>Capital allocation trade-offs</li>
</ul>

<p>
Singapore is the starting dataset due to its unique cost structures (e.g. COE, financing rules, stamp duties).  
The modelling framework itself is scalable.
</p>

<h2>How This Site Is Funded</h2>

<p>
