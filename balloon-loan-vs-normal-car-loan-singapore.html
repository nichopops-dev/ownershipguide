    <h1>Balloon Loan vs Normal Car Loan (Singapore, 2026)</h1>
    <p class="muted">Updated: February 2026</p>

    <div class="og-card og-card--hero">
      <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Balloon loans often look “cheaper” because the monthly instalment is lower. But the real question is:
      <strong>can you safely exit</strong> (sell/refinance/pay the balloon) without being forced into a bad decision?</p>

    <h2>Decision rules (simple)</h2>
    <div class="og-checklist">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prefer a normal loan</strong> if you want certainty and you are not 100% sure you can clear/refinance the balloon on time.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider a balloon loan</strong> only if you have a <strong>credible exit plan</strong>: cash set aside, high confidence of sale price, or refinancing options.</li>
        <li><strong>If the balloon is your plan</strong> (“I’ll deal with it later”), you’re not choosing a product — you’re choosing future stress.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>What’s the real tradeoff?</h2>
    <p>A balloon structure shifts risk from “monthly affordability” to <strong>exit affordability</strong>.
    You may pay less each month, but you take on a big decision later — at the worst possible time (when prices are down, COE moves, or your income changes).</p>

    <h2>Worked example (illustrative)</h2>
    <p class="muted">Numbers are simplified to show the logic. Use your actual quote and assumptions.</p>

    <table class="og-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Item</th>
          <th>Normal loan</th>
          <th>Balloon loan</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Car price</td>
          <td>$90,000</td>
          <td>$90,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Loan amount</td>
          <td>$60,000</td>
          <td>$60,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Structure</td>
          <td>5 years amortising</td>
          <td>5 years + $30,000 balloon</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Monthly payment (rough)</td>
          <td>Higher</td>
          <td>Lower</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>End-of-term obligation</td>
          <td>$0</td>
          <td>$30,000 due (balloon)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Main risk</td>
          <td>Monthly cashflow</td>
          <td>Forced exit decision</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>The balloon doesn’t disappear. You’re choosing <strong>when</strong> you pay and <strong>what happens if life changes</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Common failure modes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>“I’ll just sell the car”</strong> — but sale price is not guaranteed (COE moves, market cycles, urgent sale discount).</li>
      <li><strong>Refinance dependency</strong> — refinancing terms can change, especially if your income/credit profile changes.</li>
      <li><strong>Using balloon to stretch</strong> — if the balloon is the only way the instalment fits, the structure is masking an affordability problem.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <div class="og-faq">

      <details class="og-faq-item">
        <summary>Is a balloon loan always worse than a normal car loan?</summary>
        <div class="og-faq-body">Not always. It can be rational if you have a clear, realistic exit plan and you value near-term cashflow. The danger is using it to make a car “seem affordable” without a plan to clear the balloon.</div>
      </details>

      <details class="og-faq-item">
        <summary>What is the biggest risk of a balloon loan in Singapore?</summary>
        <div class="og-faq-body">Exit risk: you may be forced to sell, refinance, or pay a large lump sum at a bad time. If market prices or COE conditions move against you, a “cheap” monthly plan becomes an expensive decision.</div>
      </details>

      <details class="og-faq-item">
        <summary>How do I decide if I can safely take a balloon loan?</summary>
        <div class="og-faq-body">Ask: (1) Do I have cash set aside for the balloon? (2) If I must sell, what’s my conservative sale price? (3) If I must refinance, do I still qualify under stress (income down, rates up)? If any answer is uncertain, choose a normal loan.</div>
      </details>

      <details class="og-faq-item">
        <summary>Does a balloon loan change the “car vs ride-hailing” decision?</summary>
        <div class="og-faq-body">It can. Lower instalments may make ownership look cheaper month-to-month, but the balloon is still part of your ownership exposure. Compare like-for-like using total exposure and stress tests, not instalment alone.</div>
