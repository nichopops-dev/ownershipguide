  <h1>True Monthly Cost of Owning a Car in Singapore (2026 Breakdown)</h1>

  <p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <p>
    The most common mistake in Singapore is using the <strong>loan instalment</strong> as the “cost of owning a car.”
    Instalments are just the payment method.
    The true monthly cost is driven by <strong>depreciation (COE exposure)</strong>, plus insurance, fuel, maintenance,
    parking/ERP and the opportunity cost of your upfront capital.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Quick Answer (Realistic Monthly Range)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lower exposure:</strong> ~$1,900–$2,300/month</li>
    <li><strong>Typical ownership band:</strong> ~$2,300–$3,200/month</li>
    <li><strong>Higher exposure:</strong> ~$3,200–$3,500+/month</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="muted">
    These are simplified decision bands. Your actual cost depends on depreciation profile, loan size/tenure, insurer pricing, and mileage.
  </p>

  <h2>1) The Monthly Cost Categories (All-In)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Depreciation</strong> (often the largest)</li>
    <li>Loan interest (if financed)</li>
    <li>Insurance</li>
    <li>Fuel</li>
    <li>Maintenance & repairs</li>
    <li>Parking & ERP</li>
    <li>Opportunity cost of upfront capital</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Ignoring any single component produces a distorted monthly number — and most people ignore depreciation and opportunity cost.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>2) Depreciation (The Real Cost Engine)</h2>

  <p>
    In Singapore, depreciation is the real cost engine because COE sits inside it.
    A simple way to estimate depreciation per month:
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <p><strong>Depreciation per month</strong> = (Purchase price − Estimated resale value) ÷ months held</p>
  </div>

  <p>
    Example: If a car costs $150,000 and its projected value after 5 years is $80,000:
  </p>

  <p><strong>$70,000 over 5 years → ~$1,167 per month</strong></p>

    and the full framework:

  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>3) Loan Interest (If You Finance)</h2>

  <p>
    Interest cost is often underestimated because car loans are quoted using <strong>flat rates</strong>, not true EIR.
    Depending on loan size and rates, interest can add:
  </p>

  <p><strong>$200–$600 per month</strong></p>

  <p>

  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>4) Insurance</h2>

  <p>
    Typical comprehensive insurance:
  </p>

  <p><strong>$1,500–$2,500 per year → ~$125–$210 per month</strong></p>

  <p>
    Driver age, claim history, and car repair exposure move this materially.

  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>5) Fuel</h2>

  <p>
    Fuel is usage-driven. A practical band for many private drivers:
  </p>

  <p><strong>$250–$450 per month</strong></p>

  <p class="muted">
    Your exact figure depends on mileage, vehicle efficiency and fuel prices. Treat this as a planning band.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>6) Maintenance & Repairs</h2>

  <p>
    Routine servicing, tyres, wear-and-tear averaged over time:
  </p>

  <p><strong>$100–$250 per month (averaged)</strong></p>

  <p class="muted">
    The risk is volatility — one unexpected repair can distort your yearly average.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>7) Parking & ERP</h2>

  <p>
    Season parking + workplace parking + incidental parking:
  </p>

  <p><strong>$150–$350 per month</strong></p>

  <p class="muted">
    ERP depends on your routes and peak-hour frequency.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>8) Opportunity Cost (Upfront Capital)</h2>

  <p>
    If you commit $40,000 upfront and assume a 5% annual return elsewhere:
  </p>

  <p><strong>~$2,000 per year → ~$167 per month</strong></p>

  <p>
    This is rarely modelled — but financially real.

  <div class="box">
    <p><strong>Practical planning rule:</strong> If you want a conservative “don’t get surprised” number, plan for <strong>~$2,500–$3,000/month</strong> all-in unless your depreciation profile is unusually low.</p>

  <h2>10) Compare With Ride-Hailing (Decision Layer)</h2>

  <p>
    If your true monthly ownership cost is in the ~$2,000–$3,000+ zone,
    ride-hailing may be cheaper depending on your actual usage.
