    <h1>Public Transport Cost in Singapore (2026): MRT + Bus Monthly Budget Model</h1>

    <p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>
      If you’re deciding between <strong>owning a car</strong> and <strong>not owning a car</strong>,
      public transport is your baseline.
      The right question isn’t “how cheap is MRT?” — it’s:
      <strong>what is my realistic monthly MRT + bus spend, and what is the convenience gap I’m paying for with a car?</strong>
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Start here (fast path)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1)</strong> Compare against the full ownership exposure:
          <a href="/car-ownership-cost.html">Cost of Owning a Car in Singapore (5-Year Breakdown)</a>
        </li>
        <li><strong>2)</strong> If your decision is “car vs ride-hailing”, run:
          <a href="/car-vs-ride-hailing-calculator.html">Car vs Ride-Hailing Break-Even Calculator</a>
        </li>
        <li><strong>3)</strong> If you’re budgeting monthly, anchor here:
          <a href="/monthly-cost-of-owning-a-car-singapore.html">True Monthly Cost of Owning a Car</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        This page is the non-car baseline. If you still want a car, you’re paying for time, certainty, family logistics, or comfort — not “saving money”.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>What you should budget per month (realistic ranges)</h2>

    <p>
      Most adults don’t need exact fare tables to budget.
      You need a range that matches your lifestyle.
      Use these as planning bands, then validate with your actual commute.
    </p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Profile</th>
          <th>What it looks like</th>
          <th>Monthly budget (typical)</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Light commuter</td>
          <td>2 trips/day on weekdays, minimal weekends</td>
          <td>$40 – $80</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Standard worker</td>
          <td>2–4 trips/day + occasional weekend trips</td>
          <td>$70 – $140</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>High-mobility lifestyle</td>
          <td>Multiple daily trips + frequent weekends</td>
          <td>$120 – $200+</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p class="muted">
      Why bands? Because distance + transfers + timing matter.
      If you want precision, use the official fare tools (SimplyGo / TransitLink journey planners) to model your actual routes.
    </p>

    <h2>Reality check: what fares look like in 2026</h2>

    <p>
      Singapore fares are distance-based.
      As a rough anchor (card fares), many short trips start around <strong>$1.28</strong>,
      and longer trips can approach about <strong>$2.50+</strong> depending on distance.
      There’s also a <strong>morning pre-peak</strong> discount for rail if you tap in early on weekdays.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Quick modelling shortcut (good enough for decisions)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Estimate your average cost per trip (e.g. $1.30–$2.00).</li>
        <li>Trips per weekday × 22 + weekend trips.</li>
        <li>That’s your monthly baseline.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">Example: $1.60 average × (2 trips × 22 weekdays = 44) ≈ $70.40/month, before weekend trips.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Is the $122 Adult Monthly Travel Pass worth it?</h2>

    <p>
      The Adult Monthly Travel Pass is a simple question:
      <strong>will your normal month exceed $122 anyway?</strong>
      If yes, the pass can cap your spend.
      If no, it’s an overpay.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Usually worth it</strong> if you have multiple daily trips (work + errands) and you’re consistent month to month.</li>
      <li><strong>Usually not worth it</strong> if you WFH often, travel irregularly, or you’re a light commuter.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How this compares to car ownership (the convenience gap)</h2>

    <p>
      Public transport is cheap.
      Cars are not.
      The useful comparison is not “car vs MRT” — it’s:
      <strong>(true monthly car cost) − (true monthly public transport cost)</strong>.
      That difference is what you’re paying for:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>time saved (door-to-door),</li>
      <li>family logistics certainty,</li>
      <li>comfort, privacy, flexibility,</li>
      <li>and sometimes business needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you haven’t modelled your true monthly ownership costs properly, these pages matter:
      <a href="/parking-cost-singapore.html">parking</a>,
      <a href="/erp-cost-singapore.html">ERP</a>,
      <a href="/fuel-cost-singapore.html">fuel</a>,
      and (if relevant) <a href="/ev-vs-petrol-cost-singapore.html">EV vs petrol</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p><strong>Do I need to calculate exact fares to decide?</strong><br>
      Not usually. For most decisions, a monthly range is enough. Precision matters only when you’re near a break-even point (e.g., considering the monthly travel pass, or comparing against ride-hailing).</p>

    <p><strong>What’s a “normal” public transport budget for working adults?</strong><br>
      Many working adults fall in the ~$70–$140/month band depending on distance and weekend travel. Heavy movers can go higher.</p>
