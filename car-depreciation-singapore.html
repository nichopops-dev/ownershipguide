      <li>Budgeting monthly? Use <a href="/monthly-cost-of-owning-a-car-singapore.html">true monthly cost</a> and then layer depreciation on top.</li>

  <h2>What “depreciation” really means in Singapore</h2>
  <p>
    In Singapore, depreciation is usually shorthand for how much value your car loses each year.
    Because COE dominates the cost structure, depreciation often becomes the <em>single largest</em> component of ownership cost — bigger than fuel, parking, or insurance for many drivers.
  </p>

  <h2>The simplest way to estimate depreciation per month</h2>
  <p>
    A practical estimate is:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Annual depreciation</strong> = (Purchase price − Expected selling price) ÷ Years you plan to hold</li>
    <li><strong>Monthly depreciation</strong> = Annual depreciation ÷ 12</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This is not accounting math. It’s a decision tool. Your goal is to avoid underestimating your real monthly exposure.
  </p>

  <h2>Why depreciation looks “crazy” during high COE periods</h2>
  <p>
    When COE is high, you are effectively prepaying more of your usage upfront.
    If resale prices don’t rise at the same pace (or you sell at the wrong time), your depreciation spikes.
  </p>
  <p>
    That’s why timing pages like <a href="/should-i-buy-car-now-or-wait-singapore.html">buy now or wait</a> matter — not because anyone can predict COE, but because your holding period and exit plan must be realistic.
  </p>

  <h2>New vs used: where depreciation usually hits hardest</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>New cars:</strong> typically take the steepest depreciation hit early, then flatten later.</li>
    <li><strong>Used cars:</strong> often have a “known depreciation curve”, but condition, accidents, and COE cycle still matter.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you’re deciding between the two, use <a href="/used-car-vs-new-car-singapore.html">used vs new</a> and treat depreciation as the primary lever (not just monthly instalment).
  </p>

  <h2>COE renewal and depreciation</h2>
  <p>
    COE renewal changes the depreciation story because the remaining usable life is reset, but your car’s age and maintenance profile don’t disappear.
    If you’re considering renewal, read:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/coe-renewal-worth-it-singapore.html">COE renewal framework</a></li>
    <li><a href="/5-year-coe-renewal-worth-it-singapore.html">5-year renewal</a> vs <a href="/10-year-coe-renewal-worth-it-singapore.html">10-year renewal</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A quick decision framework</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Start with your true monthly ownership model</strong> (not instalment-only): <a href="/car-ownership-cost.html">full breakdown</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Set a depreciation ceiling</strong> you’re willing to “burn” per month.</li>
    <li><strong>Match your holding period</strong> to your life plan (work, kids, relocation, cash runway).</li>
    <li><strong>Pick the lowest regret exit plan</strong> — because the sale is where depreciation becomes real.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Using dealer “depre” as truth without checking assumptions.</li>
    <li>Optimistic resale price expectations.</li>
    <li>Ignoring high fixed costs because “I don’t drive much”.</li>
    <li>Overfocusing on loan instalment and underweighting depreciation.</li>
  </ul>
