    <p>
      Most buyers model entry costs (BSD/ABSD) and monthly instalment.
      Almost nobody models <strong>exit friction</strong>.
      But selling costs can materially change your net proceeds — and your ability to buy your next home.

    </ul>

    <h2 id="agent">1) Agent Commission</h2>
    <p>
      Agent commission is usually the largest explicit selling cost.
      The common market range is roughly <strong>1%–2% + GST</strong>, depending on your agreement, property type, and how competitive the listing is.
      Don’t treat it as “optional” — in practice it’s part of the exit price you pay for distribution and execution.
    </p>

    <p class="muted">
      Rule of thumb: If your expected upside is slim, selling friction can erase it.
      That’s why timing decisions matter: <a href="/should-i-buy-property-now-or-wait-singapore.html">Buy now or wait</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="legal">2) Legal &amp; Admin Fees</h2>
    <p>
      You’ll usually pay conveyancing/legal fees for the sale, plus small admin disbursements.
      The absolute number is often smaller than agent commission, but still relevant when modelling net proceeds.
    </p>

    <h2 id="loan">3) Loan Redemption &amp; Timing Penalties</h2>
    <p>
      When you sell, your outstanding loan is redeemed. Depending on your package, you may face:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Early redemption penalties (within a lock-in period)</li>
      <li>Notice periods / interest-in-lieu</li>
      <li>Administrative fees</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is why refinancing or repricing decisions should be made with your potential holding period in mind.
    </p>

    <h2 id="ssd">4) Seller’s Stamp Duty (SSD) as Exit Friction</h2>
    <p>
      SSD is the big one. If you sell inside the SSD window, it can dominate your exit cost.
      This turns “maybe I’ll flip” into “I’m trapped” — especially in uncertain markets.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      Practical framing: Before buying, ask “If I had to sell in 12–24 months, what does it cost me?”.
      Use this page as your exit model layer.
    </p>

    <h2 id="net">5) Net Proceeds Checklist (Model This, Not Headline Price)</h2>
    <p>When you sell, your usable cash is:</p>
    <div class="box">
      <strong>Net proceeds = sale price − (agent fee + legal/admin + taxes + loan redemption + misc friction)</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Outstanding loan redeemed</li>
        <li>Agent commission (+ GST)</li>
        <li>Legal conveyancing fees</li>
        <li>SSD (if applicable)</li>
        <li>Lock-in / early redemption costs</li>
        <li>Optional: basic staging / minor repairs / marketing</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      If your goal is to upgrade, net proceeds is what funds your next downpayment and liquidity floor.

    </p>

    <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

    <h3>How much does it cost to sell a property in Singapore?</h3>
    <p>Typically: agent commission (often ~1%–2% + GST), legal fees, and possibly SSD or early loan redemption costs depending on your holding period and loan terms.</p>

    <h3>Do I have to pay SSD?</h3>
    <p>SSD may apply if you sell within the SSD holding period rules. If you might sell early, model SSD before buying — it can be the largest exit friction.</p>

    <h3>What matters more: sale price or net proceeds?</h3>
    <p>Net proceeds. It determines your liquidity, your next downpayment capacity, and your ability to move. Headline price is incomplete without friction and loan redemption.</p>
