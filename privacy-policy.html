<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

<p>
Ownership Guide (“we”, “our”, “us”) operates https://ownershipguide.com (the “Site”).
This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>1) Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
We collect two broad categories of information:
</p>

<h3>A) Information you provide (optional)</h3>
<p>
If you contact us by email, you may provide personal information such as your email address and the contents of your message.
We use this only to respond to your enquiry.
</p>

<h3>B) Information collected automatically</h3>
<p>
When you visit the Site, we may collect non-personal information such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Browser type and device type</li>
  <li>Approximate location (e.g., country/city-level)</li>
  <li>Referring page and pages visited</li>
  <li>Time spent on pages and interaction events</li>
  <li>IP address (processed by providers; we do not attempt to identify you)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>2) How We Use Information</h2>

<p>
We use information to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operate and maintain the Site</li>
  <li>Understand how content is used and improve clarity/usability</li>
  <li>Measure performance of pages (e.g., which articles help users most)</li>
  <li>Support advertising and prevent fraud/abuse (where applicable)</li>
  <li>Respond to messages you send us</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>3) Analytics (Google Analytics)</h2>

<p>
We use Google Analytics to understand how visitors use the Site.
Google Analytics may use cookies and similar technologies to collect and process usage data.
</p>

<p class="muted">
Note: Analytics is used to understand aggregate trends (e.g., page popularity), not to identify individual visitors.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>4) Advertising (Google AdSense)</h2>

<p>
We may display ads served by Google AdSense.
Google and its partners may use cookies and/or device identifiers to serve ads, measure performance, and help prevent fraud.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Third-party vendors</strong>, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to this and/or other websites.</li>
  <li>Google’s use of advertising cookies (including the <strong>DoubleClick</strong> cookie) enables it and its partners to serve ads based on your visit to this Site and/or other sites.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can control or opt out of personalised advertising using Google’s settings:
<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ad Settings</a>.
</p>

<p class="muted">
Depending on your region, you may also see a consent banner that lets you manage cookie/ad preferences.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>5) Cookies</h2>

<p>
Cookies are small text files stored on your device. We (and third-party providers) may use cookies to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enable analytics and measure site performance</li>
  <li>Support advertising and frequency capping</li>
  <li>Help detect and prevent abuse or fraud</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can disable cookies through your browser settings. Note that some features may work less reliably if cookies are disabled.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>6) Third-Party Links</h2>

<p>
The Site may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties.
Please review their privacy policies separately.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>7) Data Retention</h2>

<p>
We keep analytics data only as long as needed for measurement and improvement.
If you email us, we keep emails only as long as needed to respond and for reasonable record-keeping.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>8) Data Security</h2>

<p>
We take reasonable measures to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>9) Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will be posted on this page with an updated “Last updated” date.
