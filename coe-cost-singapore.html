    <h1>COE Cost in Singapore (2026): Depreciation, Cycle Risk & 5-Year Exposure</h1>

    <p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>
      The Certificate of Entitlement (COE) is not a simple “tax”.
      It is the largest structural cost component of owning a car in Singapore.
    </p>

    <p>
      In many ownership profiles, COE alone accounts for
      <strong>50–70% of total depreciation exposure</strong>
      over a typical 5-year holding period.

    <h2 id="what-is">1) What Is COE (Structurally)?</h2>

    <p>
      A COE grants the right to own and use a vehicle in Singapore for 10 years.
      It is awarded via a bidding system and fluctuates with supply and demand.
    </p>

    <p>
      For most private car buyers, exposure is primarily Category A or Category B.
      The key insight is not category differences —
      it is that COE embeds a large capital commitment into your purchase price,
      and that capital <strong>decays over time</strong>.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="cycles">2) COE Price Cycles (Volatility Is Structural)</h2>

    <p>
      COE prices are cyclical. Over the past decade, broad ranges have looked like:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Lower cycles: ~$30,000 – $50,000</li>
      <li>Mid cycles: ~$60,000 – $90,000</li>
      <li>High spikes: $100,000+</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted">
      These illustrate volatility — not guarantees. Always reference current bidding results before committing capital.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="depreciation">3) Why COE Drives Depreciation</h2>

    <p>
      When you buy a $150,000 car in Singapore,
      a large portion of that price is COE.
      Over a 5-year holding period, depreciation is effectively:
    </p>

    <p><strong>COE decay + vehicle value decline.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Example (illustrative):
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>COE component: $100,000</li>
      <li>5 years consumed: ~50% of COE lifespan</li>
      <li>Implied COE usage cost: ~$50,000</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      That single component can exceed total ride-hailing cost for many households.
      This is why “instalment affordability” is a weak decision method.
    </p>

    <h2 id="illusion">4) The “10-Year” Illusion</h2>

    <p>
      Many buyers anchor on “10 years”.
      In practice, many owners sell within 3–6 years.
      That means your outcome depends heavily on:
      <strong>your holding period</strong> and the <strong>COE cycle at entry</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The risk pattern is simple:
      <strong>high COE + short holding period</strong> increases downside exposure.
      If your timeline is uncertain, you should treat this as a risk problem, not a prediction problem.
    </p>

    <h2 id="model">5) 5-Year COE Exposure Model (Simplified)</h2>

    <p>
      If you hold for ~5 years, a simple first-order estimate is that you consume roughly half the COE lifespan.
      That means the “COE usage cost” over 5 years is often ~50% of the 10-year COE price (before resale nuances).
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>COE Level</th>
        <th>10-Year COE Price</th>
        <th>Estimated 5-Year Usage Cost</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Lower Cycle</td>
        <td>$50,000</td>
        <td>~$25,000</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Mid Cycle</td>
        <td>$80,000</td>
        <td>~$40,000</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>High Cycle</td>
        <td>$110,000</td>
        <td>~$55,000</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

      This is a simplified lens to help you reason clearly. Real outcomes vary with car model, demand, condition, PARF/COE structure, and the cycle at exit.

    <h2 id="decision">6) When COE Should Change Your Decision</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Buying during extreme spikes increases downside exposure.</strong> The risk is amplified if you may exit early.</li>
      <li><strong>Short holding periods amplify COE timing risk.</strong> If you cannot hold, consider alternatives that reduce exposure.</li>
      <li><strong>Borderline cases often tilt away from ownership in high cycles.</strong> If you’re near break-even, COE can push the decision.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Perspective</h2>

    <p>
      COE is not just a line item.
      It is a macro-level capital allocation decision embedded inside every car purchase.
    </p>

    <p>
      The higher the COE cycle, the higher your depreciation risk and capital exposure.
      That is the cost most buyers underestimate — because it is hidden inside the “car price”.

    <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

    <h3>How much does COE cost in Singapore in 2026?</h3>
    <p>
      COE prices are cyclical and vary by category. In recent cycles, prices have ranged broadly from around $30,000 in lower cycles to above $100,000 during high spikes. Always check current bidding results before making decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>How does COE affect car depreciation in Singapore?</h3>
    <p>
      COE is embedded inside your car’s purchase price and decays over time. Over a 5-year holding period, roughly half of the COE lifespan is consumed, making COE one of the largest drivers of total depreciation exposure.
    </p>

    <h3>Is it better to buy when COE is low?</h3>
    <p>
      Buying during lower COE cycles can reduce embedded depreciation risk, but you still need to consider holding period, liquidity, and whether ownership is rational compared to ride-hailing.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is COE considered the main cost of owning a car in Singapore?</h3>
    <p>
      Because COE is embedded inside depreciation and can account for 50–70% of total depreciation over a typical 5-year ownership period, making it a dominant structural cost driver in Singapore car ownership.
