    <h1>COE Cost in Singapore (2026): Depreciation, Cycle Risk & 5-Year Exposure</h1>

    <p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>
      The Certificate of Entitlement (COE) is not a simple “tax”.
      It is the largest structural cost component of owning a car in Singapore.
    </p>

    <p>
      In many ownership profiles, COE alone accounts for
      <strong>50–70% of total depreciation exposure</strong>
      over a 5-year holding period.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1) What Is COE (Structurally)?</h2>

    <p>
      A COE grants the right to own and use a vehicle in Singapore for 10 years.
      It is awarded via a bidding system and fluctuates with supply and demand.
    </p>

    <p>
      For most private car buyers, exposure is primarily Category A or Category B.
      The key insight is not category differences —
      it is understanding that COE embeds a large capital commitment into your purchase price.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2) COE Price Cycles (Volatility Is Structural)</h2>

    <p>
      COE prices are highly cyclical. Over the past decade, broad ranges have looked like:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Lower cycles: ~$30,000 – $50,000</li>
      <li>Mid cycles: ~$60,000 – $90,000</li>
      <li>High spikes: $100,000+</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted">
      These illustrate structural volatility — not guarantees. Always reference current bidding results before committing capital.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>3) Why COE Drives Depreciation</h2>

    <p>
      When you buy a $150,000 car in Singapore,
      a large portion of that price is COE.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over 5 years, depreciation is effectively:
    </p>

    <p><strong>COE decay + vehicle value decline.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Example:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>COE component: $100,000</li>
      <li>5 years consumed: ~50% of COE lifespan</li>
      <li>Implied COE usage cost: ~$50,000</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      That single component can exceed total ride-hailing cost for many households.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>4) The “10-Year” Illusion</h2>

    <p>
      Many buyers anchor mentally on “10 years”.
      In practice, most owners sell within 3–6 years.
    </p>

    <p>
      That means COE cost is consumed faster than expected —
      and early exits during weak COE cycles can compress resale value further.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>5) 5-Year COE Exposure Model (Simplified)</h2>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>COE Level</th>
        <th>10-Year COE Price</th>
        <th>Estimated 5-Year Usage Cost</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Lower Cycle</td>
        <td>$50,000</td>
        <td>~$25,000</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Mid Cycle</td>
        <td>$80,000</td>
        <td>~$40,000</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>High Cycle</td>
        <td>$110,000</td>
        <td>~$55,000</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      This simplified model shows why COE is the dominant cost variable.
      The higher the cycle, the higher your embedded depreciation risk.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>6) When COE Should Change Your Decision</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Buying during extreme price spikes increases downside exposure.</li>
      <li>Short holding periods amplify COE timing risk.</li>
      <li>If ride-hailing spend is borderline, high COE cycles often tilt decisions away from ownership.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>7) Final Perspective</h2>

    <p>
      COE is not just a line item.
      It is a macro-level capital allocation decision embedded inside every car purchase.
    </p>

    <p>
      The higher the COE cycle,
      the higher your depreciation risk and capital exposure.
      That is the real cost most buyers underestimate.
