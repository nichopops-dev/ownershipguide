    <h1>COE Cost in Singapore (2026): What You’re Really Paying For</h1>

    <p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>
      The Certificate of Entitlement (COE) is not a “tax”.
      It is the single largest structural cost component of owning a car in Singapore.
    </p>

    <p>
      In many cases, COE alone accounts for <strong>50–70% of total depreciation exposure</strong>
      over a 5-year ownership period.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1) What Is COE, Structurally?</h2>

    <p>
      A COE grants the right to own and use a vehicle in Singapore for 10 years.
      It is awarded via a bidding system and fluctuates based on supply and demand.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are different categories (A, B, Open Category), but for most private car buyers,
      the relevant exposure is Category A or B.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2) Typical COE Price Ranges (Volatile by Nature)</h2>

    <p>
      COE prices are highly cyclical. Over the past decade, they have ranged broadly:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Lower cycle periods: ~$30,000 – $50,000</li>
      <li>Mid-cycle range: ~$60,000 – $90,000</li>
      <li>High cycle spikes: $100,000+</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted">
      These ranges illustrate structural volatility. Always refer to current bidding data before decision-making.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>3) Why COE Is the Core Depreciation Driver</h2>

    <p>
      When you buy a $150,000 car in Singapore,
      a large portion of that cost is COE.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over 5 years, depreciation is not just “car value loss”.
      It is effectively:
    </p>

    <p><strong>COE decay + vehicle value decline.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Example:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>COE component: $100,000</li>
      <li>5 years consumed: ~50% of COE lifespan</li>
      <li>Implied COE usage cost: ~$50,000</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      That alone can exceed total ride-hailing cost for many households.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>4) The 10-Year Illusion</h2>

    <p>
      Many buyers mentally anchor on “10 years”.
      But most owners sell within 3–6 years.
    </p>

    <p>
      That means you are consuming COE value at an accelerated capital rate.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you exit early during a weak COE cycle,
      resale value may compress further.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>5) 5-Year COE Exposure Model</h2>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>COE Level</th>
        <th>10-Year COE Price</th>
        <th>Estimated 5-Year Usage Cost</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Lower Cycle</td>
        <td>$50,000</td>
        <td>~$25,000</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Mid Cycle</td>
        <td>$80,000</td>
        <td>~$40,000</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>High Cycle</td>
        <td>$110,000</td>
        <td>~$55,000</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      This simplified model shows why COE is the dominant cost variable.
    </p>

    <h2>6) How COE Affects True Ownership Cost</h2>

    <p>
      When you calculate 5-year car ownership exposure
      (depreciation, insurance, fuel, maintenance, parking, opportunity cost),
      COE is embedded inside depreciation.
    </p>

    <p>

    <h2>7) When COE Cycle Should Change Your Decision</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Buying during extreme price spikes increases downside exposure.</li>
      <li>Buying during lower cycle periods reduces depreciation risk.</li>
      <li>Short holding periods amplify COE risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your ride-hailing cost is borderline, high COE cycles often tilt the decision away from ownership.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>Final Perspective</h2>

    <p>
      COE is not just a line item.
      It is a macro-level capital allocation decision.
    </p>

    <p>
      The higher the COE cycle, the higher your embedded depreciation risk.
      That is the real cost most buyers underestimate.
