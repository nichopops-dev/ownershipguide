      COE is not a simple “tax”.
      It behaves like a <strong>prepaid 10-year usage license</strong> that gets embedded into your car price —
      and then <strong>decays over time</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      That decay is why COE is the largest structural cost driver for many buyers.
      For many ownership profiles, COE-related decay can be a <strong>large share of total depreciation exposure</strong>
      over a typical 5-year hold — especially when COE levels are elevated.

    <h2>Quick Answer (What Most People Need)</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>COE is a 10-year right.</strong> You’re paying upfront for permission to own/use the vehicle.</li>
      <li><strong>Your real “COE cost” is how much of that right you consume</strong> during your holding period.</li>
      <li><strong>High COE + short holding period</strong> is the most fragile combination (timing risk).</li>

    <h2 id="what-is">1) What Is COE (The Clean Model)</h2>

    <p>
      A COE grants the right to own and use a vehicle in Singapore for <strong>10 years</strong>.
      It is allocated via a quota system and priced via bidding, so it moves with supply and demand.
    </p>

    <p>
      The important part is how it behaves economically:
      COE is a large upfront capital component that gets embedded into your purchase price —
      and then you <strong>consume</strong> it across time.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Mental model:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>COE is prepaid depreciation.</strong></li>
        <li>Your “COE cost” is <strong>how much COE right you consume during your hold</strong>.</li>
        <li>So the decision is mostly: <strong>COE level × holding period</strong>, not “monthly instalment”.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="cycles">2) COE Price Cycles (Volatility Is Structural)</h2>

    <p>
      COE prices are cyclical (and vary by category).
      As an <strong>illustrative</strong> way to think about volatility, broad bands across recent years have looked like:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Lower cycles: ~$30,000 – $50,000</li>
      <li>Mid cycles: ~$60,000 – $90,000</li>
      <li>High spikes: $100,000+</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted">
      These are not forecasts or guarantees — they exist to show that COE is not stable.
      Always reference current bidding results before committing capital.
      The point is: COE volatility flows directly into depreciation.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="depreciation">3) Why COE Drives Depreciation (5-Year Lens)</h2>

    <p>
      When you buy a $150,000 car in Singapore, a large portion of that price is COE.
      Over a 5-year holding period, depreciation is effectively:
    </p>

    <p><strong>COE decay + vehicle value decline.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Example (illustrative):
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>COE component: $100,000</li>
      <li>5 years held: ~50% of a 10-year right</li>
      <li>First-order COE usage cost: ~ $50,000 (before resale nuances)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is why instalment-based thinking is dangerous: the dominant cost is hidden inside “car price”.
      If you want the all-in model behind this, use:
      <a href="/car-ownership-cost.html">5-Year Car Ownership Breakdown</a>
      and the monthly budgeting version:

    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="illusion">4) The “10-Year” Illusion (Holding Period Is the Real Variable)</h2>

    <p>
      Many buyers anchor on “10 years”.
      In practice, many owners sell within <strong>3–6 years</strong>.
      That means your outcome depends heavily on:
      <strong>your holding period</strong> and the <strong>COE cycle at entry</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fragile pattern is simple:
      <strong>high COE + short holding period</strong> increases downside exposure.
      If your timeline is uncertain, treat it as a risk problem, not a prediction problem.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="model">5) 5-Year COE Exposure Model (Simplified)</h2>

    <p>
      If you hold for ~5 years, a simple first-order estimate is that you consume roughly half the COE right.
      That means the “COE usage cost” across 5 years is often roughly:
      <strong>~50% of the 10-year COE price</strong> (before market and structure effects).
    </p>

      <tr>
        <th>COE Level</th>
        <th>10-Year COE Price</th>
        <th>First-Order 5-Year Usage Cost</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Lower Cycle</td>
        <td>$50,000</td>
        <td>~$25,000</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Mid Cycle</td>
        <td>$80,000</td>
        <td>~$40,000</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>High Cycle</td>
        <td>$110,000</td>
        <td>~$55,000</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p class="muted">
      This is a simplified lens to help you reason clearly.
      Real outcomes vary with car model, demand, condition, and structure (e.g., ARF/PARF effects, remaining COE runway, and the cycle at exit).

    <h2 id="decision">6) When COE Should Change Your Decision</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Buying during extreme spikes increases downside exposure.</strong> The risk is amplified if you may exit early.</li>
      <li><strong>Short holding periods amplify COE timing risk.</strong> If you cannot hold, consider lower-risk structures.</li>
      <li><strong>Borderline cases often tilt away from ownership in high cycles.</strong> If you’re near break-even, COE can push the decision.</li>

    <h2>Final Perspective</h2>

    <p>
      COE is not just a line item.
      It is a macro-level capital allocation decision embedded inside every car purchase.
    </p>

    <p>
      The higher the COE cycle, the higher your depreciation risk and capital exposure.
      That is the cost most buyers underestimate — because it is hidden inside the “car price”.
    </p>

    <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

    <h3>How much does COE cost in Singapore in 2026?</h3>
    <p>
      COE prices are cyclical and vary by category. In recent cycles, prices have ranged broadly from around $30,000 in lower cycles to above $100,000 during high spikes. Always check current bidding results before making decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>How does COE affect car depreciation in Singapore?</h3>
    <p>
      COE is embedded inside your car’s purchase price and decays over time. Over a 5-year holding period, roughly half of the COE lifespan is consumed, making COE one of the largest drivers of total depreciation exposure.
    </p>

    <h3>Is it better to buy when COE is low?</h3>
    <p>
      Buying during lower COE cycles can reduce embedded depreciation risk, but you still need to consider holding period, liquidity, and whether ownership is rational compared to ride-hailing.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is COE considered the main cost of owning a car in Singapore?</h3>
    <p>
      Because COE is embedded inside depreciation and can account for a large share of total depreciation over a typical 5-year ownership period, making it a dominant structural cost driver in Singapore car ownership.
