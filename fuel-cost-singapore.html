      <p class="lede">
        Fuel is one of the only truly <strong>usage-driven</strong> parts of car ownership. If you drive more, you pay more.
        This page gives you a simple model you can use in 60 seconds — plus scenario tables — so you can budget fuel properly
        inside your true monthly car ownership cost.

      <h2 id="quick">Quick answer (budget bands)</h2>
      <p>
        If you want a simple starting band for many private drivers in Singapore:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Light usage:</strong> ~$150–$250/month</li>
        <li><strong>Typical usage:</strong> ~$250–$450/month</li>
        <li><strong>Heavy usage:</strong> ~$450–$700+/month</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        These are planning bands. Your actual spend depends mainly on mileage, your car’s fuel efficiency, and pump prices.
      </p>

      <h2 id="model">The 60-second fuel model</h2>
      <p>
        Use this model:
      </p>

      <div class="box">
        <p><strong>Fuel cost per km</strong></p>
        <p class="mono">
          cost_per_km = pump_price_per_litre / km_per_litre
        </p>
        <p><strong>Monthly fuel cost</strong></p>
        <p class="mono">
          monthly_fuel = monthly_km × cost_per_km
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="muted">
        Example: if pump price is $2.70/L and your car does 12 km/L, then cost_per_km ≈ $0.225/km.
        At 1,200 km/month, fuel ≈ $270/month.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2 id="scenarios">Scenario table (monthly)</h2>
      <p>
        Here are realistic scenario ranges (rounded). Treat this as a budgeting reference, not an exact quote.
      </p>

      <div class="table-wrap">
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Monthly km</th>
              <th>Efficiency (km/L)</th>
              <th>Pump price ($/L)</th>
              <th>Estimated fuel / month</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>800</td><td>14</td><td>2.60</td><td>~$150</td></tr>
            <tr><td>1,200</td><td>12</td><td>2.70</td><td>~$270</td></tr>
            <tr><td>1,600</td><td>11</td><td>2.80</td><td>~$410</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2,200</td><td>10</td><td>2.80</td><td>~$616</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        If your driving is mostly short trips, heavy traffic, or lots of idling, real-world efficiency can be worse than specs.

      <h2 id="drivers">What drives fuel cost up in Singapore</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>School runs / short trips:</strong> inefficient warm-up cycles, more stop-start.</li>
        <li><strong>Peak congestion:</strong> slower average speeds and more idling.</li>
        <li><strong>Heavy loads / passengers:</strong> reduces efficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Driving style:</strong> hard acceleration and late braking increases consumption.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="ownership">How fuel fits into your total car cost</h2>
      <p>
        Fuel is meaningful monthly cash out, but it’s rarely the biggest cost driver in Singapore.
        Depreciation and financing usually dominate. Still, fuel is one of the easiest costs to control by adjusting how much you drive.

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

      <h3>Should I budget fuel as a fixed number?</h3>
      <p>
        For planning, yes — pick a band (e.g., $250–$450/month) unless you track mileage. If you do track mileage, use the model above.
      </p>

      <h3>Is petrol always more expensive than ride-hailing?</h3>
      <p>
        Not directly comparable — ride-hailing includes driver time, fleet costs and surge pricing. If you’re deciding between the two,
        use the break-even tool: <a href="/car-vs-ride-hailing-calculator.html">Car vs Ride-Hailing Calculator</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>How do I reduce fuel cost without changing cars?</h3>
      <p>
        Combine trips, avoid peak hours if possible, maintain tyre pressure, drive smoother, and reduce unnecessary idling.
