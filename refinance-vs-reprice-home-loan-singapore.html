  <div class="og-hero">
    <p>This is a <strong>break-even</strong> problem, not a “best rate” problem. Decide with total costs, speed, and how much optionality you need.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>The decision in one line</h2>
  <div class="box"><ul><li>If your current bank will offer a good rate with minimal hassle: <strong>reprice</strong> first.</li><li>If you need a meaningful step-down in rate, better package terms, or your bank won’t move: <strong>refinance</strong>.</li></ul></div>

  <h2>Reprice vs refinance: what changes</h2>
  <div class="box"><ul><li><strong>Reprice</strong>: stay with the same bank; usually faster/cheaper; fewer legal steps.</li><li><strong>Refinance</strong>: switch banks; may require legal work/valuation; can unlock better terms.</li></ul></div>

  <h2>How to decide (Singapore)</h2>
  <div class="box"><ol><li><strong>Compute your “rate gap”</strong>: current effective rate vs best market rate.</li><li><strong>Estimate total costs</strong>: legal fees, valuation fees, subsidies, clawbacks, and time cost.</li><li><strong>Break-even</strong>: if savings recover costs within ~6–18 months, it’s usually worth serious consideration.</li></ol></div>

  <h2>Break-even in 60 seconds (a simple math check)</h2>
  <div class="box">
    <p><strong>Monthly interest saving</strong> ≈ outstanding balance × (rate gap) ÷ 12.</p>
    <p><strong>Break-even months</strong> ≈ total one-off costs ÷ monthly saving.</p>
    <p class="meta">Example: $800k balance, 0.60% rate gap → ~$400/month saving. If total costs are ~$2,000, break-even is ~5 months.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Cost checklist (what people forget)</h2>
  <div class="box">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Legal fees</strong> (usually refinance; sometimes waived via subsidies)</li>
      <li><strong>Valuation fee</strong> (occasionally required)</li>
      <li><strong>Package subsidies</strong> and <strong>clawback</strong> terms</li>
      <li><strong>Lock-in</strong>, early redemption penalties, and notice periods</li>
      <li><strong>Effective rate</strong> after promos end (don’t compare teaser vs steady-state)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Decision rules that work in practice</h2>
  <div class="box">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Try reprice first</strong> if your current bank is willing to match within ~0.20–0.40% of market and fees are low.</li>
      <li><strong>Refinance</strong> when the rate/terms improvement is meaningful and you’re not likely to exit soon.</li>
      <li>If you may sell/upgrade soon, prioritise <strong>optionality</strong> (low penalties, low clawbacks) over the absolute lowest headline rate.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Pitfalls that destroy the savings</h2>
  <ul><li>Ignoring <strong>lock-in</strong> and <strong>early redemption</strong> penalties.</li><li>Missing <strong>subsidy clawbacks</strong> (if applicable).</li><li>Optimising rate but accepting a structure that increases fragility (e.g., too aggressive floating without buffer).</li></ul>

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <div class="box">
    <h3>Reprice first or refinance first?</h3>
    <p>Default: ask your current bank to reprice first. If they won’t move enough, refinance becomes worth the paperwork.</p>
    <h3>What rate gap is “worth it”?</h3>
    <p>It depends on loan size and switching costs, but 0.30–0.60% on a large balance can be meaningful quickly.</p>
    <h3>What if rates are about to drop?</h3>
    <p>Then avoid long lock-ins unless the discount is large. Prefer packages that keep your exit options open.</p>

  <section class="og-card">
    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reprice</strong> if you can get a meaningful rate cut with <em>low friction</em>: minimal fees, quick approval, and your current bank is competitive.</li>
      <li><strong>Refinance</strong> if the market offers a clear step-change: a bigger rate drop, better lock-in terms, or your current bank is not matching — even after negotiations.</li>
      <li>Don’t decide on headline rate alone. Decide on <strong>all-in savings vs all-in costs</strong> over your expected holding period.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <h2>The only formula you need: break-even time</h2>
  <p>Think of refinancing/repricing as buying a discount with an upfront cost.</p>
  <div class="og-callout">
    <p><strong>Break-even (months) ≈ Upfront costs ÷ Monthly savings</strong></p>
    <p>If you will likely switch/sell/fully prepay <em>before</em> break-even, don’t do it.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>What counts as “upfront costs”</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Legal fees</li>
    <li>Valuation fee (if required)</li>
    <li>Bank admin / processing fees</li>
    <li>Fire insurance / mortgage insurance changes (if applicable)</li>
    <li>Clawbacks (e.g., subsidy clawback, early redemption penalties)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What counts as “monthly savings”</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Interest savings from the new package rate</li>
    <li>Minus any increase in monthly fees (rare, but check)</li>
    <li>Plus any cash rebates (convert to “monthly equivalent” by spreading over your holding period)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When repricing usually wins</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your bank is offering a competitive internal package and you can switch with minimal paperwork.</li>
    <li>You want to avoid legal/valuation complexity.</li>
    <li>You expect to refinance again soon and want <strong>low friction optionality</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When refinancing usually wins</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The best market package is meaningfully better (rate + lock-in + flexibility), and your bank won’t match.</li>
    <li>You want to change package type (e.g., SORA/board-rate structure, lock-in style, prepayment terms).</li>
    <li>You’re restructuring (e.g., adding/removing borrower, changing tenure) and repricing doesn’t solve it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common Singapore gotchas</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lock-in vs “effective lock-in”</strong>: even with no lock-in, check for clawbacks or penalty clauses.</li>
    <li><strong>Partial prepayment rules</strong>: some packages penalise prepayment above a threshold.</li>
    <li><strong>Rate mechanics</strong>: understand what moves (SORA + spread, fixed step-down, board rate). The risk profile differs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Decision checklist</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>How long do you realistically keep this loan? (sell/upgrade/refinance horizon)</li>
    <li>What is the all-in cost of switching?</li>
    <li>What is the realistic monthly saving (not just the first 3 months teaser)?</li>
    <li>What is the break-even month?</li>
    <li>Do lock-in / prepayment rules match your likely future actions?</li>
  </ol>
