    <h1>Renovation Cost in Singapore (2026): The Real Cash Shock After You Buy</h1>

    <p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>
      Renovation is usually the first post-purchase shock.
      It’s not “nice to have” — it’s the practical step that turns a unit into a livable asset.
      The problem is that renovation spend is often <strong>underestimated</strong> and <strong>poorly timed</strong>, creating a liquidity squeeze right after you’ve already paid BSD, downpayment, and legal fees.
    </p>

    <h2 id="bands">1) Planning Bands (Budget Without Lying to Yourself)</h2>

    <p>
      Renovation budgets are best planned in bands:
      <strong>light refresh</strong>, <strong>functional renovation</strong>, and <strong>full overhaul</strong>.
      Exact numbers depend on size, condition, and how much carpentry/wet works you do — but the banding approach prevents optimistic budgeting.
    </p>

    <div class="table-wrap">
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Band</th>
            <th>Typical scope</th>
            <th>Who it fits</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Light refresh</strong></td>
            <td>Paint, minor fixtures, simple furniture/appliances, small touch-ups</td>
            <td>Units in good condition; buyers prioritising liquidity</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Functional renovation</strong></td>
            <td>Kitchen/toilet refresh, basic carpentry, lighting, aircon, targeted rewiring</td>
            <td>Most resale buyers; “move-in ready” without over-customisation</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Full overhaul</strong></td>
            <td>Major hacking, full wet works, heavy carpentry, full electrical/plumbing refresh</td>
            <td>Older units; buyers willing to trade liquidity for a custom build</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p class="muted">
      Renovation spend is easiest to justify when it improves <strong>livability</strong> and <strong>durability</strong>, not when it tries to “out-design” the market.
    </p>

    <h2 id="drivers">2) What Actually Drives Renovation Cost</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Carpentry:</strong> wardrobes, kitchen cabinets, feature walls (custom = expensive)</li>
      <li><strong>Wet works:</strong> toilets, kitchen, waterproofing, tiling</li>
      <li><strong>Electrical:</strong> rewiring, DB upgrades, lighting plans</li>
      <li><strong>Aircon:</strong> system, trunking, installation complexity</li>
      <li><strong>Doors/windows:</strong> replacements, grilles, window works</li>
      <li><strong>Condition & age:</strong> older resale units hide more surprises</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="hidden">3) Hidden Items People Forget</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Hacking + debris disposal</li>
      <li>Defects and rectification (especially resale)</li>
      <li>Pest treatment / mould remediation</li>
      <li>Plumbing replacements (not just fixtures)</li>
      <li>Waterproofing repairs before tiles go in</li>
      <li>Appliances + soft furnishing (often excluded from “reno quote”)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="timeline">4) Payment Timing (Avoid the Cash Shock)</h2>
    <p>
      Renovation payments are commonly staged:
      deposit → milestone → completion.
      This matters because your biggest cash drains tend to cluster around purchase completion.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Practical planning rule</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep a dedicated renovation fund separate from your emergency fund</li>
        <li>Hold a <strong>10–20% buffer</strong> on top of your expected renovation spend</li>
        <li>If you are financing renovation, compare it against your mortgage interest exposure: <a href="/mortgage-interest-cost-singapore.html">Mortgage Interest Cost</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="rules">5) Decision Rules (Avoid Over-Renovating)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If renovation spend forces you to run “near-zero cash”, you are buying fragility.</li>
      <li>Prioritise durability upgrades (electrical, plumbing, waterproofing) over cosmetic upgrades.</li>
      <li>Don’t renovate for resale fantasy. Renovate for the holding period you can actually commit to.</li>
      <li>Use the full exposure model to sanity check: <a href="/property-ownership-cost-singapore.html">Property Ownership Cost</a>.</li>
    </ul>
